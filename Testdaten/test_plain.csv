  abstract =     ""One of the most important and challenging areas of
                 research in evolutionary algorithms is to investigate
                 ways to successfully apply evolutionary algorithms to
                 larger and more complicated problems. One approach to
                 make a given problem more tractable is to discover
                 problem representations automatically. Koza (1993) uses
                 the even-n-parity problem to demonstrate extensively
                 that his approach of Automatic Function Definition
                 (ADF) can facilitate the solution of the problem.
                 Unfortunately, the solutions found by GP with ADF can
                 only solved the problem for a particular value of n. If
                 a different value of n is used, GP with ADF must be
                 used again to find other programs that can solve the
                 new even-n-parity problem. Clearly, the solution found
                 is not general enough to solve all even-n-parity
                 problem for n greater than or equal to zero. In this
                 paper, we apply GGP (Generic Genetic Programming) to
                 evolve general recursive functions for the
                 even-n-parity problem. GGP is very flexible and
                 programs in various programming languages can be
                 acquired. Moreover, it is powerful enough to represent
                 context-sensitive information and domain-dependent
                 knowledge. This knowledge can be used to accelerate the
                 learning speed and/or improve the quality of the
                 programs induced. A number of experiments have been
                 performed to determine the impact of domain-specific
                 knowledge on the speed of learning."",

  abstract =     ""Hyper-heuristics represent a novel search methodology
                 that is motivated by the goal of automating the process
                 of selecting or combining simpler heuristics in order
                 to solve hard computational search problems. An
                 extension of the original hyper-heuristic idea is to
                 generate new heuristics which are not currently known.
                 These approaches operate on a search space of
                 heuristics rather than directly on a search space of
                 solutions to the underlying problem which is the case
                 with most meta-heuristics implementations. In the
                 majority of hyper-heuristic studies so far, a framework
                 is provided with a set of human designed heuristics,
                 taken from the literature, and with good measures of
                 performance in practice. A less well studied approach
                 aims to generate new heuristics from a set of potential
                 heuristic components. The purpose of this chapter is to
                 discuss this class of hyper-heuristics, in which
                 Genetic Programming is the most widely used
                 methodology. A detailed discussion is presented
                 including the steps needed to apply this technique,
                 some representative case studies, a literature review
                 of related work, and a discussion of relevant issues.
                 Our aim is to convey the exciting potential of this
                 innovative approach for automating the heuristic design
                 process."",

                 non-recursive application of a higher-order function.
                 It divides a program recursion pattern into two parts:
                 the recursion code and the application of the code.
                 With the higher-order functions handling recursion code
                 application, GP effort becomes focused on the
                 generation of recursion code.

                 We employed this method to evolve two recursive
                 programs: strstr C library function and programs that
                 produce the Fibonacci sequence. In both cases, the

                 networks, has been proposed in this work. With the
                 increase in the problem scale, dealing with such
                 alternating routes becomes difficult due to increased
                 computational load and possible entanglement of the
                 results in sub-optimal solutions due to infeasibilities
                 in the MILP space. In this work, the genetic algorithm
                 (GA) has been used as a jumping operator to the
                 different terms of the discrete search space and for
                 the generation of different feasible fixed
                 configurations. This proposed approach eliminates the
                 need for the reformulation of the discrete
                 /discontinuous optimization problems into direct MINLP
                 problems, thus allowing for the solution of the
                 original problem as a continuous optimization problem
                 but only at each individual discrete and reduced search
                 space."",

  abstract =     ""The multiple-instance problem is a difficult machine
                 learning problem that appears in cases where knowledge
                 about training examples is incomplete. In this problem,
                 the teacher labels examples that are sets (also called
                 bags) of instances. The teacher does not label whether
                 an individual instance in a bag is positive or
                 negative. The learning algorithm needs to generate a
                 classifier that will correctly classify unseen examples
                 (i.e., bags of instances). This learning framework is
                 receiving growing attention in the machine learning
                 community and since it was introduced by Dietterich,
                 Lathrop, Lozano-Perez (1997), a wide range of tasks
                 have been formulated as multi-instance problems. Among
                 these tasks, we can cite content-based image retrieval
                 (Chen, Bi, & Wang, 2006) and annotation (Qi and Han,
                 2007), text categorisation (Andrews, Tsochantaridis, &
                 Hofmann, 2002), web index page recommendation (Zhou,
                 Jiang, & Li, 2005; Xue, Han, Jiang, & Zhou, 2007) and
                 drug activity prediction (Dietterich et al., 1997; Zhou
                 & Zhang, 2007). In this chapter we introduce MOG3P-MI,
                 a multiobjective grammar guided genetic programming
                 algorithm to handle multi-instance problems. In this
                 algorithm, based on SPEA2, individuals represent
                 classification rules which make it possible to
                 determine if a bag is positive or negative. The quality
                 of each individual is evaluated according to two
                 quality indexes: sensitivity and specificity. Both
                 these measures have been adapted to MIL circumstances.
                 Computational experiments show that the MOG3P-MI is a
                 robust algorithm for classification in different
                 domains where achieves competitive results and obtain

                 developing multiagent systems in the domains where
                 human programming alone is not sufficient to take into
                 account all the details of possible situations.
                 However, existing GP methods attempt to evolve
                 collective behavior immediately from primitive actions.
                 More realistic tasks require several emergent behaviors
                 and a proper coordination of these is essential for
                 success. We have recently proposed a framework, called
                 fitness switching, to facilitate learning to coordinate
                 composite emergent behaviors using genetic programming.
                 Coevolutionary fitness switching described in this
                 chapter extends our previous work by introducing the
                 concept of coevolution for more effective
                 implementation of fitness switching. Performance of the
                 presented method is evaluated on the table transport
                 problem and a simple version of simulated robot soccer
                 problem. Simulation results show that coevolutionary
                 fitness switching provides an effective mechanism for
                 learning complex collective behaviors which may not be
                 evolved by simple genetic programming."",

                 tree-based genetic programming approach, where each
                 genetic program returns just one floating point number
                 that is then translated into different class labels,
                 this approach invents a new program structure with
                 multiple outputs, each for a particular class. A voting
                 scheme is then applied to these output values to
                 determine the class of the input object. The approach
                 is examined and compared with the standard genetic
                 programming approach on four multiclass object
                 classification tasks with increasing difficulty. The
                 results show that the new approach outperforms the

                 the proposed program structure is that it can easily

                 the dimensionality of the decision space. We search for
                 the set of mappings with optimal dimensionality to
                 project the input space into a decision space with
                 maximized class separability. The steady-state Pareto
                 converging genetic programming (PCGP) has been used to
                 implement this multi-dimensional MOGP. We examine the
                 proposed method using eight benchmark datasets from the
                 UCI database and the Statlog project to make
                 quantitative comparison with conventional classifiers.
                 We conclude that MMOGP outperforms the comparator
                 classifiers due to its optimized feature extraction
                 process."",
