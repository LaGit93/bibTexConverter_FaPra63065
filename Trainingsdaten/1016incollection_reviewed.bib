                 concerned with discovering patterns, associations and
                 periodicity in real world data. This chapter presents
                 two real world applications where evolutionary
                 computation has been used to solve network management
                 problems. First, we investigate the suitability of
                 linear genetic programming (LGP) technique to model
                 fast and efficient intrusion detection systems, while
                 comparing its performance with artificial neural
                 networks and classification and regression trees.
                 Second, we use evolutionary algorithms for a Web
                 usage-mining problem. Web usage mining attempts to
                 discover useful knowledge from the secondary data
                 obtained from the interactions of the users with the
                 Web. Evolutionary algorithm is used to optimise the
                 concurrent architecture of a fuzzy clustering algorithm
                 (to discover data clusters) and a fuzzy inference
                 system to analyse the trends. Empirical results clearly
                 shows that evolutionary algorithm could play a major
                 rule for the problems considered and hence an important
                 data mining tool.",

                 to the researcher facing difficult optimisation
                 problems. These advantages are multi-fold, including
                 the simplicity of the approach, its robust response to
                 changing circumstance, its flexibility, and many other
                 facets. The evolutionary approach can be applied to
                 problems where heuristic solutions are not available or
                 generally lead to unsatisfactory results. As a result,
                 evolutionary computation have received increased
                 interest, particularly with regards to the manner in
                 which they may be applied for practical problem
                 solving.

                 we review the development of the field of evolutionary
                 computations from standard genetic algorithms to
                 genetic programming, passing by evolution strategies
                 and evolutionary programming. For each of these
                 orientations, we identify the main differences from the
                 others. We also, describe the most popular variants of

                 considered to lack the strong separation between
                 genotype and phenotype found in natural evolution. In
                 many cases, the genotype and the phenotype are
                 considered identical in GP since the program
                 representation does not undergo any modification prior
                 to its encounter with �environment� in the form of
                 inputs and a fitness function. However, this view
                 overlooks a key fact: fitness in GP is determined
                 without reference to the makeup of the individual
                 programs but evolutionary changes occur in the
                 structure and content of the individual without
                 reference to its fitness. This creates a disconnect
                 between �genetic recombination� and fitness similar to
                 that in nature that can create unexpected effects
                 during the evolution of a population and suggests an
                 important dynamic that has not been thoroughly
                 considered by the GP community. This paper describes
                 some of the observed effects of this disconnect and
                 studies some approaches for the estimating diversity of
                 a population which could lead to a new way of modelling
                 the dynamics of GP. We also speculate on the similarity
                 of these effects and some recently studied aspects of

  abstract =     "The notion of ``evolvability'' --- the ability of a
                 population to produce variants fitter than any yet
                 existing --- is developed as it applies to genetic
                 algorithms. A theoretical analysis of the dynamics of
                 genetic programming predicts the existence of a novel,
                 emergent selection phenomenon: the evolution of
                 evolvability. This is produced by the proliferation,
                 within programs, of blocks of code that have a higher
                 chance of increasing fitness when added to programs.
                 Selection can then come to mold the {\em variational}
                 aspects of the way evolved programs are represented. A
                 model of code proliferation within programs is analyzed
                 to illustrate this effect. The mathematical and
                 conceptual framework includes: the definition of
                 evolvability as a measure of performance for genetic
                 algorithms; application of Price's {\em Covariance and
                 Selection Theorem} to show how the fitness function,
                 representation, and genetic operators must interact to
                 produce evolvability --- namely, that genetic operators
                 produce offspring with fitnesses specifically
                 correlated with their parent's fitnesses; how blocks of
                 code emerge as a new level of replicator, proliferating
                 as a function of their ``constructional fitness'',
                 which is distinct from their schema fitness; and how
                 programs may change from innovative code to
                 conservative code as the populations mature. Several
                 new selection techniques and genetic operators are
                 proposed in order to give better control over the
                 evolution of evolvability and improved evolutionary
                 performance.

                 through allelic substitution in that new genes bring
                 with them new degrees of freedom for genetic
                 variability. Selection in the evolution of new genes
                 can therefore act to sculpt the dimensions of
                 variability in the genome. This ``constructional''
                 selection effect is an evolutionary mechanism, in
                 addition to genetic modification, that can affect the
                 variational properties of the genome and its
                 evolvability.

                 One consequence is a form of genic selection: genes
                 with large potential for generating new useful genes
                 when duplicated ought to proliferate in the genome,
                 rendering it ever more capable of generating adaptive
                 variants. A second consequence is that alleles of new
                 genes whose creation produced a selective advantage may
                 be more likely to also produce a selective advantage,
                 provided that gene creation and allelic variation have
                 correlated phenotypic effects. A fitness distribution
                 model is analyzed which demonstrates these two effects
                 quantitatively.

                 These are effects that select on the nature of the
                 genotype-phenotype map. New genes that perturb numerous
                 functions under stabilizing selection, i.e. with high
                 pleiotropy, are unlikely to be advantageous. Therefore,
                 genes coming into the genome ought to exhibit low
                 pleiotropy during their creation. If subsequent
                 offspring genes also have low pleiotropy, then genic
                 selection can occur. If subsequent allelic variation
                 also has low pleiotropy, then that too should have a
                 higher chance of not being deleterious.

                 The effects on pleiotropy are illustrated with two
                 model genotype-phenotype maps: Wagner's linear
                 quantitative-genetic model with Gaussian selection, and
                 Kauffman's ``NK'' adaptive landscape model.
                 Constructional selection is compared with other
                 processes and ideas about the evolution of constraints,
                 evolvability, and the genotype-phenotype map. Empirical
                 phenomena such as dissociability in development,
                 morphological integration, and exon shuffling are
                 discussed in the context of this evolutionary
                 process.

                 for evolvability run into the problem of how we parse
                 the organism into traits. In order to resolve the
                 question of multiplicity, there needs to be a way to
                 get the human observer out of the way, and define
                 modularity in terms of physical processes. I will offer
                 two candidate ideas towards this resolution:

                 the dimensionality of phenotypic variation, and

                 the causal screening off of phenotypic variables by
                 other phenotypic variables.

                 With this framework, the evolutionary advantages that
                 have been attributed to modularity do not derive from
                 modularity per se. Rather, they require that there be
                 an 'alignment' between the spaces of phenotypic
                 variation, and the selection gradients that are
                 available to the organism. Modularity may facilitate
                 such alignment, but it is not sufficient; the
                 appropriate phenotype-fitness map in conjunction with
                 the genotype-phenotype map is also necessary for
                 evolvability.

                 Conclusion

                 I have endeavoured in this essay to delve into some of
                 the low-level conceptual issues associated with the
                 idea of modularity in the genotype-phenotype map. My
                 main proposal is that the evolutionary advantages that
                 have been attributed to modularity do not derive from
                 modularity per se. Rather, they require that there be
                 an 'alignment' between the spaces of phenotypic
                 variation, and the selection gradients that are
                 available to the organism. Modularity in the
                 genotype-phenotype map may make such an alignment more
                 readily attained, but it is not sufficient; the
                 appropriate phenotype-fitness map in conjunction with
                 the genotype-phenotype map is also necessary for
                 evolvability.",

  abstract =     "For broad classes of selection and genetic operators,
                 the dynamics of evolution can be completely
                 characterised by the spectra of the operators that
                 define the dynamics, in both infinite and finite
                 populations. These classes include generalised
                 mutation, frequency-independent selection, uniparental
                 inheritance. Several open questions exist regarding
                 these spectra: 1. For a given fitness function, what
                 genetic operators and operator intensities are optimal
                 for finding the fittest genotype? The concept of rapid
                 first hitting time, an analog of Sinclair's rapidly
                 mixing Markov chains, is examined.

                 2. What is the relationship between the spectra of
                 deterministic infinite population models, and the
                 spectra of the Markov processes derived from them in
                 the case of finite populations?

                 3. Karlin proved a fundamental relationship between
                 selection, rates of transformation under genetic
                 operators, and the consequent asymptotic mean fitness
                 of the population. Developed to analyse the stability
                 of polymorphisms in subdivided populations, the theorem
                 has been applied to unify the reduction principle for
                 self-adaptation, and has other applications as well.
                 Many other problems could be solved if it were
                 generalised to account for the interaction of different
                 genetic operators. Can Karlin's theorem on operator
                 intensity be extended to account for mixed genetic
                 operators?",

                 and a network of processing nodes using the transputer

                 supercomputers at a cost that is intermediate between
                 the two. This approach is illustrated by a comparison

                 I realized that inherent dynamics of genetic
                 programming encouraged certain emergent properties. The
                 most important of these is that introns emerge
                 naturally from the process to protect the developing
                 program from crossover. Others in the field think this
                 extra stuff in the genetic program is a bad thing,
                 reflected by their choice of the term {"}bloating{"}
                 for the effect. This chapter is the first to take a
                 positive view on GP introns and other emergent
                 phenomena. I think this is the first paper to associate
                 the {"}extra{"} code in genetic programs with the
                 intron concept.",

  abstract =     "Genetic Programming is a new method to generate
                 computer programs. It was derived from the model of
                 biological evolution. Programs are 'bred' through
                 continuous improvement of an initially random
                 population of programs. Improvements are made possible
                 by stochastic variation of programs and selection
                 according to prespecified criteria for judging the
                 quality of a solution. Programs of Genetic Programming
                 systems evolve to solve predescribed automatic
                 programming and machine learning problems. In this
                 contribution the origins and the context of Genetic
                 Programming are discussed. The primary mechanisms
                 behind the working of the method are then outlined.
                 Next is a review of the state-of-the-art of Genetic
                 Programming, including the major achievements of the
                 method in recent years. This leads to an overview of
                 the application areas where GP is most frequently used
                 to present. Among these areas is robotics and the
                 control of behavior, both of real and virtual agents.
                 The article will conclude with a section on
                 methodological issues and future directions. The use of
                 Genetic Programming for simulation in the social
                 sciences is briefly sketched.",

  abstract =     "One of the major challenges in an information-rich
                 financial market is how effectively to derive an
                 optimum investment solution among vast amounts of
                 available information. The most efficacious combination
                 of factors or information signals can be found by
                 evaluating millions of possibilities, which is a task
                 well beyond the scope of manual efforts. Given the
                 limitations of the manual approach, factor combinations
                 are typically linear. However, the linear combination
                 of factors might be too simple to reflect market
                 complexities and thus fully capture the predictive
                 power of the factors. A genetic programming process can
                 easily explore both linear and non-linear formulae. In
                 addition, the ease of evaluation facilitates the
                 consideration of broader factor candidates for a stock
                 selection model. Based upon SSgA's previous research on
                 using genetic programming techniques to develop
                 quantitative investment strategies, we extend our
                 application to develop stock selection models in a
                 large investable stock universe, the S&P 500 index. Two
                 different fitness functions are designed to derive GP
                 models that accommodate different investment
                 objectives. First, we demonstrate that the GP process
                 can generate a stock selection model for an low active
                 risk investment style. Compared to a traditional model,
                 the GP model has significantly enhanced future stock
                 return ranking capability. Second, to suit an active
                 investment style, we also use the GP process to
                 generate a model that identifies the stocks with future
                 returns lying in the fat tails of the return
                 distribution. A portfolio constructed based on this
                 model aims to aggressively generate the highest returns
                 possible compared to an index following portfolio. Our
                 tests show that the stock selection power of the GP
                 models is statistically significant. Historical
                 backtest results indicate that portfolios based on GP
                 models outperform the benchmark and the portfolio based
                 on the traditional model. Further, we demonstrate that
                 GP models are more robust in accommodating various
                 market regimes and have more consistent performance
                 than the traditional model.",

                 management face the challenge of determining the most
                 efficacious factors, and how they interact, from large
                 amounts of financial data. Genetic programming using
                 simple objective fitness functions has been shown to be
                 an effective technique for selecting factors and
                 constructing multi-factor models for ranking stocks,
                 but the resulting models can be somewhat unbalanced in
                 satisfying the multiple objectives that portfolio
                 managers seek: large excess returns that are consistent
                 across time and the cross-sectional dimensions of the
                 investment universe. In this study, we implement and
                 evaluate three multi-objective algorithms to
                 simultaneously optimise the information ratio,
                 information coefficient, and intra-fractile hit rate of
                 a portfolio. These algorithms the constrained fitness
                 function, sequential algorithm, and parallel algorithm
                 take widely different approaches to combine these
                 different portfolio metrics. The results show that the
                 multi-objective algorithms do produce well-balanced
                 portfolio performance, with the constrained fitness
                 function performing much better than the sequential and
                 parallel multi-objective algorithms. Moreover, this
                 algorithm generalises to the held-out test data set
                 much better than any of the single fitness
                 algorithms.",

  abstract =     "In this chapter, an application of the Evolutionary
                 Design (ED) is demonstrated. The aim of the design was
                 to develop a controller which provides recovery of a
                 fixed-wing UAV onto a ship under the full range of
                 disturbances and uncertainties that are present in the
                 real world environment. The controller synthesis is a
                 multistage process. However, the approach employed for
                 synthesis of each block is very similar. Evolutionary
                 algorithm is used as a tool to evolve and optimise the
                 control laws. One of the greatest advantages of this
                 methodology is that minimum or no a priori knowledge
                 about the control methods is used, with the synthesis
                 starting from the most basic proportional control or
                 even from `null' control laws. During the evolution,
                 more complex and capable laws emerge automatically. As
                 the resulting control laws demonstrate, evolution does
                 not tend to produce parsimonious solutions. The method
                 demonstrating remarkable robustness in terms of
                 convergence indicating that a near optimal solution can
                 be found. In very limited cases, however, it may take
                 too long time for the evolution to discover the core of
                 a potentially optimal solution, and the process does
                 not converge. More often than not, this hints at a poor
                 choice of the algorithm parameters. The most important
                 and difficult problem in Evolutionary Design is
                 preparation of the fitness evaluation procedure with
                 predefined special intermediate problems. Computational
                 considerations are also of the utmost importance.
                 Robustness of EAs comes at the price of computational
                 cost, with many thousands of fitness evaluations
                 required. The simulation testing covers the entire
                 operational envelope and highlights several conditions
                 under which recovery is risky. All environmental
                 factors--sea wave, wind speed and turbulence--have been
                 found to have a significant effect upon the probability
                 of success. Combinations of several factors may result
                 in very unfavourable conditions, even if each factor
                 alone may not lead to a failure. For example, winds up
                 to 12 m/s do not affect the recovery in a calm sea, and
                 a severe ship motion corresponding to Sea State 5 also
                 does not represent a serious threat in low winds. At
                 the same time, strong winds in a high Sea State may be
                 hazardous for the aircraft.",

  abstract =     "Most large firms use both share and debt capital to
                 provide long-term finance for their operations. The
                 debt capital may be raised from a bank loan, or may be
                 obtained by selling bonds directly to investors. As an
                 example of the scale of US bond markets, the value of
                 new bonds issued in 2004 totaled $5.48 trillion, and
                 the total value of outstanding marketable bond debt at
                 31 December 2004 was $23.6 trillion [1]. In comparison,
                 the total global market capitalisation of all companies
                 quoted on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) at
                 31/12/04 was $19.8 trillion [2]. Hence, although
                 company stocks attract most attention in the business
                 press, bond markets are actually substantially
                 larger.

                 When a company issues traded debt (e.g. bonds), it must
                 obtain a credit rating for the issue from at least one
                 recognised rating agency (Standard and Poor's (S&P),
                 Moody's and Fitches'). The credit rating represents an
                 agency's opinion, at a specific date, of the credit
                 worthiness of a borrower in general (a bond-issuer
                 credit-rating), or in respect of a specific debt issue
                 (a bond credit rating). These ratings impact on the
                 borrowing cost, and the marketability of issued bonds.
                 Although several studies have examined the potential of
                 both statistical and machine-learning methodologies for
                 credit rating prediction [3-6], many of these studies
                 used relatively small sample sizes, making it difficult
                 to generalise strongly from their findings. This study
                 by contrast, uses a large dataset of 791 firms, and
                 introduces pi GE to this domain.",

  abstract =     "There is a great need for accurate predictions of
                 foreign exchange rates. Many industries participate in
                 foreign exchange scenarios with little idea where the
                 exchange rate is moving, and what the optimum decision
                 to make at any given time is. Although current economic
                 models do exist for this purpose, improvements could be
                 made in both their flexibility and adaptability. This
                 provides much room for models that do not suffer from
                 such constraints. This chapter proposes the use of a
                 genetic program (GP) to predict future foreign exchange
                 rates. The GP is an extension of the DyFor GP tailored
                 for forecasting in dynamic environments. The GP is
                 tested on the Australian / US (AUD/USD) exchange rate
                 and compared against a basic economic model. The
                 results show that the system has potential in

                 established models. Further improvements are also

  abstract =     "Accurate software effort estimation is an important
                 part of the software process. Originally, estimation
                 was performed using only human expertise, but more
                 recently attention has turned to a variety of machine
                 learning methods. This paper attempts to critically
                 evaluate the potential of genetic programming (GP) in
                 software effort estimation when compared with
                 previously published approaches. The comparison is
                 based on the well-known Desharnais data set of 81
                 software projects derived from a Canadian software
                 house in the late 1980s. It shows that GP can offer
                 some significant improvements in accuracy and has the
                 potential to be a valid additional tool for software
                 effort estimation.",

                 the development and analysis of the ensemble learning
                 approach of genetic programming. As evolution proceeds,
                 this approach suggests that the mutual information
                 between the target and models should: (i) not decrease
                 in the population; (ii) concentrate in fewer
                 individuals; and (iii) be distilled from the inputs,
                 eliminating excess entropy. Normalised information
                 theoretic indices are developed to measure fitness and
                 diversity of ensembles, without a priori knowledge of
                 how the multiple constituent models might be composed
                 into a single model. With the use of these indexes for
                 reproductive and survival selection, building blocks
                 are less likely to be lost and more likely to be
                 recombined. Price's Theorem is generalised to pair
                 selection, from which it follows that the heritability
                 of information should be stronger than the heritability
                 of error, improving evolvability. We support these
                 arguments with simulations using a logic function
                 benchmark and a time series application. For a chaotic
                 time series prediction problem, for instance, the
                 proposed approach avoids familiar difficulties
                 (premature convergence, deception, poor scaling, and
                 early loss of needed building blocks) with standard GP
                 symbolic regression systems; information-based fitness
                 functions showed strong intergenerational correlations
                 as required by Price's Theorem.",

                 parsimonious empirical models acceptable for industrial
                 applications. The chapter addresses the issue of
                 finding the optimal parameter settings of Pareto front
                 GP which direct the simulated evolution toward simple
                 models with acceptable prediction error. A generic
                 methodology based on statistical design of experiments
                 is proposed. It includes determination of the number of
                 replicates by half-width confidence intervals,
                 determination of the significant factors by fractional
                 factorial design of experiments, approaching the
                 optimum by steepest ascent/descent, and local
                 exploration around the optimum by Box Behnken design of
                 experiments. The results from implementing the proposed
                 methodology to different types of industrial data sets
                 show that the statistically significant factors are the
                 number of cascades, the number of generations, and the
                 population size. The optimal values for the three
                 parameters have been defined based on second order
                 regression models with R2 higher than 0.97 for small,
                 medium, and large-sized data sets. The robustness of
                 the optimal parameters toward the types of data sets
                 was explored and a robust setting for the three
                 significant parameters was obtained. It reduces the
                 calculation time by 30per cent to 50per cent without

                 representative agents normally made in mainstream
                 economics, are removed. In this model, traders
                 stochastically update their forecasts by searching the

  abstract =     "Over the last decade, numerous papers have
                 investigated the use of Genetic Programming (GP) for
                 creating financial trading strategies. Typically, in
                 the literature, the results are inconclusive but the
                 investigators always suggest the possibility of further
                 improvements, leaving the conclusion regarding the
                 effectiveness of GP undecided. In this paper, we
                 discuss a series of pretests aimed at giving more
                 clear-cut answers as to whether GP can be effective
                 with the training data at hand. Precisely, pretesting
                 allows us to distinguish between a failure due to the
                 market being efficient or due to GP being inefficient.
                 The basic idea here is to compare GP with several
                 variants of random searches and random trading
                 behaviors having well-defined characteristics. In
                 particular, if the outcomes of the pretests reveal no
                 statistical evidence that GP possesses a predictive
                 ability superior to a random search or a random trading
                 behavior, then this suggests to us that there is no
                 point in investing further resources in GP. The
                 analysis is illustrated with GP-evolved strategies for
                 nine markets exhibiting various trends.",

  abstract =     "Vector autoregressions are widely used in
                 macroeconomic forecasting since they became known in
                 the 1970s. Extensions including vector error correction
                 models, co-integration and dynamic factor models are
                 all rooted in the framework of vector autoregression.
                 The three important extensions are demonstrated to have
                 formal equivalence between each other. Above all, they
                 all emphasise the importance of common trends or common
                 factors. Many researches, including a series of work of
                 Stock and Watson, find that common factor models
                 significantly improve accuracy in forecasting
                 macroeconomic time series. This study follows the work
                 of Stock and Watson. The authors propose a hybrid
                 framework called genetic programming based vector error
                 correction model (GPVECM), introducing genetic
                 programming to traditional econometric models. This new
                 method could construct common factors directly from
                 nonstationary data set, avoiding differencing the
                 original data and thus preserving more information. The
                 authors' model guarantees that the constructed common
                 factors satisfy the requirements of econometric models
                 such as co-integration, in contrast to the traditional
                 approach. Finally but not trivially, their model could
                 save lots of time and energy from repeated work of unit
                 root tests and differencing, which they believe is
                 convenient for practitioners. An empirical study of
                 forecasting US import from China is reported. The
                 results of the new method dominates those of the plain
                 vector error correction model and the ARIMA model.",

                 of new molecular diagnostics. This work focuses on
                 discovering simple, accurate rules that diagnose
                 diseases based on changes of gene expression profiles
                 within a diseased cell. GP is shown to be a useful
                 technique for discovering classification rules in a
                 supervised learning mode where the biological genotype
                 is paired with a biological phenotype such as a disease
                 state. In the process of developing these rules it is
                 necessary to develop new techniques for establishing
                 fitness and interpreting the results of evolutionary
                 runs because of the large number of independent
                 variables and the comparatively small number of
                 samples. These techniques are described and issues of
                 overfitting caused by small sample sizes and the
                 behaviour of the GP system when variables are missing

                 uncover simple data generating functions that have the
                 flavor of strategic rules. We then apply symbolic
                 regression using genetic programming to experimental

                 programming paradigm is most suited due to its

                 to model agents with real characteristics implies a

                 designed to efficiently solve specific problems. Some
                 of these are that we use very small populations, it is
                 based on different operators and uses a breeding
                 selection mechanism. It is precisely some of the
                 {"}pathological{"} features of this algorithm that
                 capture the target behaviour. Some possibilities for
                 integration of deductive logic-based approaches and the

  abstract =     "Evolutionary finance studies the dynamic interaction
                 of investment strategies in financial markets. This
                 market interaction generates a stochastic wealth
                 dynamic on a heterogenous population of traders through
                 the fluctuation of asset prices and their random
                 payoffs. Asset prices are endogenously determined
                 through short-term market clearing. Investors'
                 portfolio choices are characterized by investment
                 strategies that provide a descriptive model of decision
                 behavior. The mathematical framework of these models is
                 given by random dynamical systems.

                 This chapter surveys the recent progress made by the
                 authors in the theory and applications of evolutionary
                 finance models. An introduction to and the motivation
                 of the modeling approach is followed by a theoretical
                 part that presents results on the market selection (and
                 coexistence) of investment strategies, discusses the
                 relation to the Kelly Rule and implications for
                 asset-pricing theory, and introduces a continuous-time
                 mathematical finance version. Applications are
                 concerned with simulation studies of market dynamics,
                 empirical estimation of asset prices and their
                 dynamics, and evolution of investment strategies using

                 algorithms (EAs), particularly genetic algorithms and
                 genetic programming. First we provide a brief overview
                 of EAs. Then the remaining text is divided into three
                 parts. Section 2 discusses the use of EAs for KDD. The
                 emphasis is on the use of EAs in attribute selection
                 and in the optimization of parameters for other kinds
                 of KDD algorithms (such as decision trees and nearest
                 neighbour algorithms). Section 3 discusses three
                 research problems in the design of an EA for KDD,
                 namely: how to discover comprehensible rules with
                 genetic programming, how to discover surprising
                 (interesting) rules, and how to scale up EAs with
                 parallel processing. Finally, section 4 discusses what
                 the added value of KDD is for EAs. This section
                 includes the remark that generalization performance on
                 a separate test set (unseen during training, or EA run)
                 is a basic principle for evaluating the quality of
                 discovered knowledge, and then suggests that this
                 principle should be followed in other EA
                 applications.",

                 location in an individual{'}s execution tree to
                 another. The branch can be understood as alternatively

                 to a potentially infinite number of automatically
                 defined functions. This paper describes the proposed

                 then implemented in a real world system, and the
                 performance effects of the branch operator are

                 problems: the artificial ant problem and the lawnmower
                 problem. [1,2] The branch is found to provide some

                 low-level language like C or a higher-level language
                 like LISP, we are accustomed to using high-level
                 control constructs like functions, loops, if
                 statements, and recursion to control the path of
                 execution and maximize code reuse. The thought of using

                 predictions has been widely established. This chapter
                 introduces two Genetic Programming (GP) techniques:
                 Multi-Expression Programming (MEP) and Linear Genetic
                 Programming (LGP) for the prediction of two stock
                 indices. The performance is then compared with an
                 artificial neural network trained using
                 Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and Takagi-Sugeno
                 neuro-fuzzy model. We considered Nasdaq-100 index of
                 Nasdaq Stock Market and the S&P CNX NIFTY stock index
                 as test data. Empirical results reveal that Genetic
                 Programming techniques are promising methods for stock
                 prediction. Finally formulate an ensemble of these two
                 techniques using a multiobjective evolutionary
                 algorithm. Results obtained by ensemble are better than
                 the results obtained by each GP technique

                 maintained a logical model of the agent's world and
                 planned by reasoning about what plans do to that world.
                 In this chapter I describe a new planner, the Genetic
                 Planner, that uses artificial selection, sexual mixing
                 (recombination) and fitness proportionate reproduction
                 to breed computer programs (i.e., to plan). This
                 planner uses a simulation of the world to execute
                 candidate computer programs (i.e., candidate plans). I
                 first describe this planner and then I show it at work
                 on a simple problem---a robot on a 2-D grid. Also,

  abstract =     "An obvious problem confronting humanoid robotics is
                 the generation of stable and efficient gaits. Whereas
                 wheeled robots normally are statically balanced and
                 remain upright regardless of the torques applied to the
                 wheels, a bipedal robot must be actively balanced,
                 particularly if it is to execute a human-like, dynamic
                 gait. The success of gait generation methods based on
                 classical control theory, such as the zero-moment point
                 (ZMP) method (Takanishi et al., 1985), relies on the
                 calculation of reference trajectories for the robot to
                 follow. In the ZMP method, control torques are
                 generated in order to keep the zero-moment point within
                 the convex hull of the support area defined by the
                 feet. When the robot is moving in a well-known
                 environment, the ZMP method certainly works well.
                 However, when the robot finds itself in a dynamically
                 changing real-world environment, it will encounter
                 unexpected situations that cannot be accounted for in
                 advance. Hence, reference trajectories can rarely be
                 specified under such circumstances. In order to address
                 this problem, alternative, biologically inspired
                 control methods have been proposed, which do not
                 require the specification of reference trajectories.
                 The aim of this chapter is to describe one such method,
                 based on central pattern generators (CPGs), for control
                 of bipedal robots.",

  abstract =     "Introduction. Genetic programming (GP) may be seen as
                 a machine learning method, which induces a population
                 of computer programs by evolutionary means (Banzhaf et
                 al. 1998). Genetic programming has been used
                 successfully in generating computer programs for
                 solving a number of problems in a wide range of areas.
                 In (Hoai and McKay 2001), we proposed a framework for a
                 grammar-guided genetic programming system called
                 Tree-Adjunct Grammar Guided Genetic Programming
                 (TAG3P), which uses tree-adjunct grammars along with a
                 context-free grammar to set language bias in genetic
                 programming. The use of tree-adjunct grammars can be
                 seen as a process of building context-free grammar
                 guided programs in the two dimensional space. In this
                 chapter, we show some results of TAG3P on the
                 trigonometric identity discovery problem. The
                 organisation of the remainder of the chapter is as
                 follows. In section 2, we give a brief overview of
                 genetic programming, grammar guided genetic
                 programming, tree-adjunct grammars and TAG3P. The
                 problem of finding trigonometric identities will be
                 given in section 3. Section 4 contains the experiment
                 and results of TAG3P on that problem. The nature of
                 search space is empirically analysed and the bias by
                 selective adjunction is introduced. The last section
                 contains conclusion and future work.",

                 Adjoining Grammar (TAG) formalism provides a more
                 flexible Genetic Programming tree representation which
                 supports a wide range of operators while retaining the
                 advantages of tree-based representation. In particular,
                 minimal-change point insertion and deletion operators
                 may be defined. Previous work has shown that point
                 insertion and deletion, used as local search operators,
                 can dramatically reduce search effort in a range of
                 standard problems. Here, we evaluate the effect of
                 local search with these operators on a real-World
                 ecological time series modelling problem. For the same
                 search effort, TAG-based GP with the local search
                 operators generates solutions with significantly lower
                 training set error. The results are equivocal on test
                 set error, local search generating larger individuals
                 which generalise only a little better than the less

                 of evolutionary design systems, it is not of interest
                 to scale them up to produce more sophisticated designs.
                 Here we argue that for computer-automated design
                 systems to scale to producing more sophisticated
                 results they must be able to produce designs with
                 greater structure and organisation. By structure and
                 organization we mean the characteristics of modularity,
                 reuse and hierarchy (MR&amp;H), characteristics that
                 are found both in man-made and natural designs. We
                 claim that these characteristics are enabled by
                 implementing the attributes of combination,
                 control-flow and abstraction in the representation, and
                 define metrics for measuring MR&amp;H and define two
                 measures of overall structure and organisation by
                 combining the measures of MR&amp;H. To demonstrate the
                 merit of our complexity measures, we use an
                 evolutionary algorithm to evolve solutions to different
                 sizes for a table design problem, and compare the
                 structure and organisation scores of the best tables
                 against existing complexity measures. We find that our
                 measures better correlate with the complexity of good
                 designs than do others, which supports our claim that
                 MR&amp;H are important components of complexity. We
                 also compare evolution using five representations with
                 different combinations of MR&amp;H, and find that the
                 best designs are achieved when all three of these
                 attributes are present. The results of this second set
                 of experiments demonstrate that implementing
                 representations with MR&amp;H can greatly improve
                 search performance.",

                 Given any of these application domains, a set of

                 often requires domain-specific GP configuration,
                 especially of the GP function sets. As a case study, it
                 is shown how the open-ended topology search capability

                 (MDL) principle to define fitness functions in Genetic
                 Programming (GP). In traditional (Koza-style) GP, the
                 size of trees was usually controlled by user-defined
                 parameters, such as the maximum number of nodes and
                 maximum tree depth. Large tree sizes meant that the
                 time necessary to measure their fitnesses often
                 dominated total processing time. To overcome this
                 difficulty, we introduce a method for controlling tree
                 growth, which uses an MDL principle. Initially we
                 choose a {"}decision tree{"} representation for the GP

  abstract =     "On the emergence of the cooperative behaviour for
                 multiple agents by means of Genetic Programming (GP).
                 Our experimental domains are multi-agent test beds,
                 i.e., the robot navigation task and the Tile World. The
                 world consists of a simulated robot agent and a
                 simulated environment which is both dynamic and
                 unpredictable. In our previous paper, we proposed three
                 types of strategies, i.e, homogeneous breeding,
                 heterogeneous breeding, and co-evolutionary breeding,
                 for the purpose of evolving the cooperative behavior.
                 We use the heterogeneous breeding in this paper. The
                 previous Q-learning approach commonly used for the
                 multi-agent task has the difficulty with the
                 combinatorial explosion for many agents. This is
                 because the state space for Q-table is so huge for the
                 practical computer resources. We show how successfully
                 GP-based multi-agent learning is applied to multi-agent
                 tasks and compare the performance with Q-learning by
                 experiments. Thereafter, we conduct experiments with
                 the evolution of the communicating agents. The
                 communication is an essential factor for the emergence
                 of cooperation. This is because a collaborative agent
                 must be able to handle situations in which conflicts
                 arise and must be capable of negotiating with other
                 agents to reach an agreement. The effectiveness of the
                 emergent communication is empirically shown in terms of
                 the robustness of generated GP programs.",

                 and reproduction in Genetic Programming (GP). Among
                 these genetic operators, the crossover operator mainly
                 contributes to searching for a solution program.
                 Therefore, we aim at improving the program generation
                 by extending the crossover operator. The normal
                 crossover selects crossover points randomly and
                 destroys building blocks. We think that building blocks
                 can be protected by swapping larger substructures. In
                 our former work, we proposed a depth-dependent
                 crossover. The depth-dependent crossover protected
                 building blocks and constructed larger building blocks
                 easily by swapping shallower nodes. However, there was
                 problem-dependent characteristics on the
                 depth-dependent crossover, because the depth selection
                 probability was fixed for all nodes in a tree. To solve
                 this difficulty, we propose a self-tuning mechanism for
                 the depth selection probability. We call this type of
                 crossover a {"}self-tuning depth-dependent
                 crossover{"}. We compare GP performances of the
                 selftuning depthdependent crossover with performances
                 of the original depth-dependent crossover. Our
                 experimental results clarify the superiority of the

                 architectural design. L-systems are explained briefly
                 and two contrasting embryology strategies are outlined.
                 Artificial selection is discussed, and the wide
                 divergence of opinion as to what might constitute an
                 architectural configuration illustrated. Examples of
                 successful single-goal evolution are presented, with
                 the space syntax measure of integration investigated as
                 a generic identifier of architectural form. Dual-and
                 multigoal evolution are considered within the context
                 of the architectural design discipline. It is suggested
                 that an appropriate response to the complex nature of
                 architectural organisms is the development of a
                 symbiotic coevolutionary metaphor where interwoven

                 species. The classification of these species leads
                 toward a more architecture-specific genetic code. An
                 outline of future work intended to develop such a
                 representation begins with the identification of a
                 naive architectural form representation and summarizes
                 a gradual process for the refinement of this
                 representation into a genuinely useful encoding of
                 architectural form.",

  abstract =     "Genetic Programming requires that all
                 functions/terminals (tree labels) be given a priori. In
                 the absence of specific information about the solution,
                 the user is often forced to provide a large set, thus
                 enlarging the search space often resulting in reducing
                 the search efficiency. Moreover, based on heuristics,
                 syntactic constraints, or data typing, a given subtree
                 may be undesired or invalid in a given context. Typed
                 Genetic Programming methods give users the power to
                 specify some rules for valid tree construction, and
                 thus to prune the otherwise unconstrained
                 representation in which Genetic Programming operates.
                 However, in general, the user may not be aware of the
                 best representation space to solve a particular
                 problem. Moreover, some information may be in the form
                 of weak heuristics. In this work, we present a
                 methodology, which automatically adapts the
                 representation for solving a particular problem, by
                 extracting and using such heuristics. Even though many
                 specific techniques can be implemented in the
                 methodology, in this paper we use information on local
                 first-order (parent-child) distributions of the
                 functions and terminals. The heuristics are extracted
                 from the population by observing their distribution in
                 better individuals. The methodology is illustrated and
                 validated using a number of experiments with the
                 11-multiplexer. Moreover, some preliminary empirical
                 results linking population size and the sampling rate
                 are also given.",

                 learning that uses a generative approach to assess the
                 learner's ability to recognise image contents. Each
                 learner, implemented as a genetic programming (GP)
                 individual, processes visual primitives that represent
                 local salient features derived from the input image.
                 The learner analyses the visual primitives, which
                 involves mostly their grouping and selection,
                 eventually producing a hierarchy of visual primitives
                 build upon the input image. Based on that it provides
                 partial reproduction of the shapes of the analysed
                 objects and is evaluated according to the quality of
                 that reproduction.We present the method in detail and
                 verify it experimentally on the real-world task of
                 recognition of hand-drawn shapes. In particular, we
                 show how GP individuals trained on examples from
                 different decision classes can be combined to build a
                 complete multiclass recognition system. We compare such
                 recognition systems to reference methods, showing that
                 our generative learning approach provides similar
                 results. This chapter also contains detailed analysis

                 its breadth of application increases, the need for
                 parallel implementations becomes absolutely necessary.
                 The transputer-based system presented in [Koza95] is
                 one of the rare such parallel implementations. Until
                 today, no implementation has been proposed for parallel
                 GP using a SIMD architecture, except for a
                 data-parallel approach [tufts95], although others have
                 exploited workstation farms and pipelined
                 supercomputers. One reason is certainly the apparent
                 difficulty of dealing with the parallel evaluation of
                 different S-expressions when only a single instruction
                 can be executed at the same time on every processor.
                 The aim of this chapter is to present such an
                 implementation of parallel GP on a SIMD system, where
                 each processor can efficiently evaluate a different
                 S-expression. We have implemented this approach on a
                 MasPar MP-2 computer, and will present some timing
                 results. To the extent that SIMD machines, like the
                 MasPar are available to offer cost-effective cycles for
                 scientific experimentation, this is a useful
                 approach.

                 which uses the problem specific terminals and functions
                 defined before a run as an alphabet. The other is a
                 minimal Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that uses a
                 variable alphabet of complete subtrees. This chapter
                 will show that the DAG representation can replace
                 S-Expression representation without any change in the
                 functionality of a genetic programming system. In
                 certain situations the amount of memory needed to
                 represent a population can be reduced enormously when
                 using a DAG. The implementation of Automatically
                 Defined Functions (ADFs) in a DAG gives rise to the
                 definitions of a divergent ADF, and a compact ADF. The
                 latter can represent huge programs in S-Expression
                 format with a few elements.

  abstract =     "The purpose of our current research is to investigate
                 the design and implementation of a Genetic Programming
                 platform in C++, with primary focus on efficiency and
                 flexibility. In this chapter we consider the lower
                 level implementation aspects of such a platform,
                 specifically, the Genome Interpreter. The fact that
                 Genetic Programming is a computationally expensive task
                 means that the overall efficiency of the platform in
                 both memory and time is crucial. In particular, the
                 node representation is the key part of the
                 implementation in which the overhead will be magnified.
                 We first compare a number of ways of storing the
                 topology of the tree. The most efficient representation
                 overall is one in which the program tree is a linear
                 array of nodes in prefix order as opposed to a pointer
                 based tree structure. We consider trade-offs with other
                 linear representations, namely postfix and arbitrary
                 positioning of functions and their arguments. We then
                 consider how to represent which function or terminal
                 each node represents, and demonstrate a very efficient
                 one to two byte representation. Finally, we integrate
                 these approaches and offer a prefix/jump-table (PJT)
                 approach which results in a very small overhead per
                 node in both time and space compared to the other
                 approaches we investigated. In addition to being
                 efficient, our interpreter is also very flexible.
                 Finally, we discuss approaches for handling flow
                 control, encapsulation, recursion, and simulated
                 parallel programming.",

                 standard CAD object description format such that its
                 representation can be efficiently used in a CAD process
                 like redesign. To that end, a digitising process
                 represents the object surface as a weakly-structured
                 discrete and digitized set of 3D points. Surface
                 reconstruction attempts to transform this

                 number and becoming complex. This has prompted the use

                 based on intelligent perceptual shaping of a digital
                 watermark using Genetic Programming (GP). The proposed

                 appropriate DCT position selection and information

                 developing superior perceptual shaping functions using

                 exploiting the sensitivities/insensitivities of Human

                 optimisation approach to balancing expression
                 complexity and accuracy, has proven to have significant
                 impact on symbolic regression of industrial data due to
                 its improvement in speed and quality of model
                 development as well as user model selection.

                 In this chapter, we explore a range of topics related
                 to exploiting the Pareto paradigm. First we describe
                 and explore the strengths and weaknesses of the
                 ClassicGP and ParetoGP variants for symbolic regression
                 as well as touch on related algorithms.

                 Next, we show a derivation for the selection intensity
                 of tournament selection with multiple winners (albeit,
                 in a single-objective case). We then extend classical
                 tournament and elite selection strategies into a
                 multi-objective framework which allows classical GP
                 schemes to be readily Pareto-aware.

                 Finally, we introduce the latest extension of the
                 Pareto paradigm which is the melding with ordinal
                 optimization. It appears that ordinal optimisation will
                 provide a theoretical foundation to guide algorithm
                 design. Application of these insights has already
                 produced at least a four-fold improvement in the
                 performance for a suite of test problems.",

                 in the real world since changes in the underlying
                 system or use of the model in new regions of parameter
                 space can produce (potentially dangerous) incorrect
                 predictions. The trepidation involved with model usage
                 can be mitigated by assembling ensembles of diverse
                 models and using their consensus as a trust metric,
                 since these models will be constrained to agree in the
                 data region used for model development and also
                 constrained to disagree outside that region. The
                 problem is to define an appropriate model complexity
                 (since the ensemble should consist of models of similar
                 complexity), as well as to identify diverse models from
                 the candidate model set. In this chapter we discuss
                 strategies for the development and selection of robust
                 models and model ensembles and demonstrate those
                 strategies against industrial data sets. An important
                 benefit of this approach is that all available data may
                 be used in the model development rather than a
                 partition into training, test and validation subsets.
                 The result is constituent models are more accurate
                 without risk of over-fitting, the ensemble predictions
                 are more accurate and the ensemble predictions have a
                 meaningful trust metric.",

                 based on the multi-variate numeric data. We emphasize
                 the necessity to perform data modeling in a global

                 adaptation, model building, and problem reduction
                 procedures. We demonstrate it for the problem of
                 detecting outliers and extracting significant features

                 {http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/CountryData.html}
                 -- a data set of economic, political, social and
                 geographic data collected. We present two complementary
                 ways of extracting outliers from the data -the
                 content-based and the model-based approach. The
                 content-based approach studies the geometrical
                 structure of the multi-variate data, and uses
                 data-balancing algorithms to sort the data records in
                 the order of decreasing typicalness, and identifies the
                 outliers as the least typical records before the
                 modeling is applied to a data set. The model-based
                 outlier detection approach uses symbolic regression via
                 Pareto genetic programming to identify records which
                 are systematically under- or over-predicted by diverse
                 ensembles of (thousands of) global non-linear symbolic
                 regression models.

                 Both approaches applied to the CountryData produce
                 insights into outlier vs. prototypes division among
                 world countries and about driving economic properties

  abstract =     "Research in the field of artificial life focuses on
                 computer programs that exhibit some of the properties
                 of biological life (e.g. self-reproducibility,
                 evolutionary adaptation to an environment, etc.). In
                 one area of artificial life research, human programmers
                 write intentionally simple computer programs (often
                 incorporating observed features of actual biological
                 processes) and then study the 'emergent' higher level
                 behavior that may be exhibited by such seemingly simple
                 programs. In this chapter, we consider a different
                 problem, namely, 'How can computer programs be
                 automatically written by the computer itself using only
                 measurements of a given program's performance?' In
                 particular, this chapter describes the recently
                 developed 'genetic programming paradigm' which
                 genetically breeds populations of computer programs in
                 order to find a computer program that solves the given
                 problem. In the genetic programming paradigm, the
                 individuals in the population are hierarchical
                 compositions of functions and arguments. The
                 hierarchies are of various sizes and shapes.
                 Increasingly fit hierarchies are then evolved in
                 response to the problem environment using the genetic
                 operations of fitness proportionate reproduction
                 (Darwinian survival and reproduction of the fittest)
                 and crossover (sexual recombination). In the genetic
                 programming paradigm, the size and shape of the
                 hierarchical solution to the problem is not specified
                 in advance. Instead, the size and shape of the
                 hierarchy, as well as the contents of the hierarchy,
                 evolve in response to the Darwinian selective pressure
                 exerted by the problem environment.

                 This ALIFE-90 chapter also describes an extension of
                 the genetic programming paradigm to the case where two
                 (or more) populations of hierarchical computer programs
                 simultaneously co-evolve. In co-evolution, each
                 population acts as the environment for the other
                 population. In particular, each individual of the first
                 population is evaluated for 'relative fitness' by
                 testing it against each individual in the second
                 population, and, simultaneously, each individual in the
                 second population is evaluated for relative fitness by
                 testing them against each individual in the first
                 population. Over a period of many generations,
                 individuals with high 'absolute fitness' may evolve as
                 the two populations mutually bootstrap each other to
                 increasingly high levels of fitness.

                 The genetic programming paradigm is illustrated by
                 genetically breeding a population of hierarchical
                 computer programs to allow an 'artificial ant' to
                 traverse an irregular trail. In addition, we
                 genetically breed a computer program controlling the
                 behavior of an individual ant in an ant colony which,
                 when simultaneously executed by a large number of ants,
                 causes the emergence of interesting collective behavior
                 for the colony as a whole. Co-evolution is illustrated
                 with a problem involving finding an optimal strategy
                 for playing a simple discrete two-person competitive
                 game represented by a game tree in extensive form.",

                 observed variables measuring a system. In many
                 conventional modeling techniques, one necessarily
                 begins by selecting the size and shape of the model.
                 After making this choice, one usually then tries to
                 find the values of certain coefficients required by the
                 particular model so as to achieve the best fit between
                 the observed data and the model. But, in many cases,
                 the most important issue is the size and shape of the
                 model itself.

                 Finding the functional form of the model can be viewed
                 as searching a space of possible computer programs for
                 the particular computer program which produces the
                 desired output for given inputs. This most fit computer

                 that produces some desired output for particular
                 inputs. When viewed in this way, the process of solving

                 of possible computer programs for a highly fit
                 individual computer program. The recently developed
                 genetic programming paradigm described herein provides
                 a way to search the space of possible computer programs

                 (or approximately solve) a surprising variety of

                 an illustrative problem that has considerable
                 regularity, symmetry, and homogeneity in its problem
                 environment to compare genetic programming with and
                 without the newly developed mechanism of automatic
                 function definition. Genetic programming with automatic
                 function definition can automatically decompose a
                 problem into simpler subproblems, solve the
                 subproblems, and assemble the solutions to the
                 subproblems into a solution to the original overall
                 problem. The solutions to the problem produced by
                 genetic programming with automatic function definition
                 are more parsimonious than those produced without it.
                 Genetic programming requires fewer fitness evaluations
                 to yield a solution to the problem with 99percent
                 probability with automatic function definition than
                 without it. When we consider the three differently
                 sized versions of the problem we find that the size of
                 the solutions produced without automatic function
                 definition can be expressed as a direct multiple of
                 problem size. In contrast, the average size of

                 expressed as a certain minimum size representing the
                 overhead associated with automatic function definition;
                 however, there is only a very slight increase in the
                 average size of the solutions with problem size.
                 Moreover, the number of fitness evaluations required to
                 yield a solution to the problem with a 99percent
                 probability grows very rapidly with problem size
                 without automatic function definition, but this same

                 the biological theory of gene duplication described in
                 Susumu Ohno's provocative book, Evolution by Means of
                 Gene Duplication, was brought to bear on a vexatious
                 problem from the domain of automated machine learning
                 in the computer science field. The resulting
                 biologically-motivated approach using six new
                 architecture-altering operations enables genetic
                 programming to automatically discover the size and
                 shape of the solution at the same time as it is
                 evolving a solution to the problem

                 Genetic programming with the architecture-altering
                 operations was used to evolve a computer program to
                 classify a given protein segment as being a
                 transmembrane domain or non-transmembrane area of the
                 protein (without biochemical knowledge, such as
                 hydrophobicity values). The best genetically-evolved
                 program achieved an out-of-sample error rate that was
                 better than that reported for other previously reported
                 human-constructed algorithms. This is an instance of an
                 automated machine learning algorithm that is
                 competitive with human performance on a non-trivial
                 problem.",

                 gene duplication described in Susumu Ohno's provocative
                 book, Evolution by Means of Gene Duplication, was
                 brought to bear on a vexatious problem from the domain
                 of automated machine learning. The goal of automatic
                 programming is to create, in an automated way, a
                 computer program that enables a computer to solve a
                 problem. Ideally, an automatic programming system
                 should require that the user pre-specify little about
                 the problem environment. Genetic programming is a
                 domain-independent approach to automated machine
                 learning that attempts to evolve a computer program
                 that solves, or approximately solves, problems.
                 Starting with a primordial ooze of randomly generated
                 computer programs composed of the available
                 programmatic ingredients, genetic programming applies
                 the principles of animal husbandry (including Darwinian
                 selection and sexual recombination) to breed new (and
                 often improved) populations of computer programs. One
                 of the undesirable aspects of many techniques of
                 automated machine learning is that the user of the
                 technique may be required to specify the size and shape
                 (i.e., the architecture) of the ultimate solution to
                 his problem before he can begin to apply the technique
                 to his problem. Specification of the size and shape of
                 the solution often corresponds to discovering a way to
                 decompose the problem into useful subspaces (usually of
                 lower dimensionality) or to discovering a congenial
                 representation of the problem that facilitates solution
                 of the problem. Thus, in practice, for many problems of
                 interest, determining the size and shape of the
                 solution may be the problem (or at least a substantial
                 part of the problem). This chapter describes how
                 biology motivated a solution to the problem of
                 architecture discovery for genetic programming. The
                 resulting biologically-motivated approach enables
                 genetic programming to automatically discover the size
                 and shape of the solution at the same time as genetic
                 programming is evolving a solution to the problem. This
                 is accomplished using six new architecture-altering
                 operations that provide a way to automatically
                 discover, during a run of genetic programming, both the
                 architecture and the sequence of steps of a multi-part
                 computer program that will solve the given problem.",

                 computationally intractable. Design engineers typically
                 perform these tasks sequentially - thus forcing the
                 engineer to grapple with one vexatious or intractable

                 to the automatic creation of a circuit's topology,

                 with a high level statement of the requirements for the

                 patentable new inventions (controllers). There are
                 seven promising factors suggesting that these previous
                 results can be extended to deliver industrial-strength
                 automated design of analog circuits, but two
                 countervailing factors. This chapter explores the
                 question of whether the seven promising factors can
                 overcome the two countervailing factors by reviewing
                 progress on an ongoing project in which we are
                 employing genetic programming to synthesise an
                 amplifier circuit. The work involves a multiobjective
                 fitness measure consisting of 16 different elements
                 measured by five different test fixtures. The chapter
                 describes five ways of using general domain knowledge
                 applicable to all analog circuits, two ways for
                 employing problem-specific knowledge, four ways of
                 improving on previously published genetic programming
                 techniques, and four ways of grappling with the
                 multiobjective fitness measures associated with
                 real-world design problems.",

                 indisputably difficult problems, patented inventions,
                 and results that tie or beat human contestants in
                 regulated competitions. We argue that the pursuit of
                 human competitive results is not only a worthy goal in
                 itself, but a useful compass for guiding the future
                 growth of the field. We say this for reasons of
                 utility, objectivity, complexity, and interminability.
                 We believe that the continuing generation of evermore
                 important human-competitive results relies on progress
                 in three areas of research: multiobjective
                 optimisation, parallel computing, and the development

  abstract =     "INTRODUCTION The goal of getting computers to
                 automatically solve problems is central to artificial
                 intelligence, machine learning, and the broad area
                 encompassed by what Turing called machine intelligence
                 (Turing, 1948, 1950). In his talk entitled AI: Where It
                 Has Been and Where It Is Going, machine learning
                 pioneer Arthur Samuel stated the main goal of the
                 fields of machine learning and artificial
                 intelligence:

                 [T]he aim [is] . . . to get machines to exhibit
                 behavior, which if done by humans, would be assumed to
                 involve the use of intelligence. (Samuel, 1983)

                 Genetic programming is a systematic method for getting
                 computers to automatically solve a problem starting
                 from a high-level statement of what needs to be done.
                 Genetic programming is a domain-independent method that
                 genetically breeds a population of computer programs to
                 solve a problem. Specifically, genetic programming
                 iteratively transforms a population of computer
                 programs into a new generation of programs by applying
                 analogs of naturally occurring genetic operations.",

                 programming to automatically synthesise
                 human-competitive designs of complex structures in six
                 engineering domains, namely analogue electrical
                 circuits, optical lens systems, controllers, antennas,
                 mechanical systems, and quantum computing circuits.
                 First, the paper identifies common features observed in
                 the human-competitive results produced by genetic
                 programming in the six domains and suggests possible
                 explanations for the observed similarities. Second, the
                 paper identifies the characteristics that make a
                 particular domain amenable to the application of
                 genetic programming for the automatic synthesis of
                 designs. Third, the paper discusses certain
                 domain-specific adjustments in technique that may
                 increase the efficiency of the automated process in a
                 particular domain. Fourth, the paper discusses several
                 technique issues that have arisen in more than one
                 domain.",

                 programming populations has been widely reported. In a

                 standard protective code explanation and find it to be
                 incomplete. We suggest bloat is primarily due to
                 distribution of fitness in the space of possible
                 programs and because of this, in the absence of bias,
                 it is in general inherent in any search technique using
                 a variable length representation.

                 We investigate the fitness landscape produced by
                 program tree-based genetic operators when acting upon
                 points in the search space. We show bloat in common
                 operators is primarily due to the exponential shape of
                 the underlying search space. Nevertheless we
                 demonstrate new operators with considerably reduced
                 bloating characteristics. We also describe mechanisms
                 whereby bloat arises and relate these back to the shape
                 of the search space. Finally we show our simple random
                 walk entropy increasing model is able to predict the

  abstract =     "I explore several extensions to genetic programming
                 for applications involving the forecasting of real
                 world chaotic time series. We first used Genetic
                 Symbolic Regression (GSR),which is the standard genetic
                 programming technique applied to the forecasting
                 problem in the same way that it is often applied to
                 symbolic regression problems [ Koza 1992, 1994]. We
                 observed that the performance of GSR depends on the
                 characteristics of the time series, and in particular
                 that it worked better for deterministic time series
                 than it did for stochastic or volatile time series.
                 Taking a hint from this observation, an assumption was
                 made in this study that the dynamics of a time series
                 comprise a deterministic and a stochastic part. By
                 subtracting the model built by GSR for the
                 deterministic part from the original time series, the
                 stochastic part would be obtained as a residual time
                 series. This study noted the possibility that GSR could
                 be used recursively to model the residual time series
                 of rather stochastic dynamics, which may still comprise
                 another deterministic and stochastic part. An algorithm
                 called GRR (Genetic Recursive Regression) has been
                 developed to apply GSR recursively to the sequence of
                 residual time series of stochastic dynamics, giving
                 birth to a sequence of sub-models for deterministic
                 dynamics extractable at each recursive application. At
                 each recursive application and after some termination
                 conditions are met, the submodels become the basis
                 functions for a series-expansion type representation of
                 a model. The numerical coefficients of the model are
                 calculated by the least square method with respect to
                 the predetermined region of the time series data set.
                 When the region includes the latest data set, the model
                 reflects the most recent changes in the dynamics of a
                 time series, thus increasing the forecasting
                 performance. This chapter shows how GRR has been
                 successfully applied to many real world chaotic time
                 series. The results are compared with those from other
                 GSR-like methods and various soft-computing
                 technologies such as neural networks. The results show
                 that GRR saves much computational effort while
                 achieving enhanced forecasting performance for several
                 selected problems.",

                 network design is formulated as an optimisation problem
                 of network configuration and design variables, where
                 both operating and investment cost are optimised
                 simultaneously. Genetic Programming(GP) was used to
                 solve the optimization problem. The encode mode to
                 represent WUN configuration has been studied. Several
                 general unit operations have been selected, such as
                 column, splitter, mix, regenerate, etc., which
                 constitute the GP function set. The primary advantage

  abstract =     "We present an evolved X-band antenna design and flight
                 prototype currently on schedule to be deployed on
                 NASA�s Space Technology 5 (ST5) spacecraft. Current
                 methods of designing and optimising antennas by hand
                 are time and labour intensive, limit complexity, and
                 require significant expertise and experience.
                 Evolutionary design techniques can overcome these
                 limitations by searching the design space and
                 automatically finding effective solutions that would
                 ordinarily not be found. The ST5 antenna was evolved to
                 meet a challenging set of mission requirements, most
                 notably the combination of wide beam width for a
                 circularly-polarised wave and wide bandwidth. Two
                 evolutionary algorithms were used: one used a genetic
                 algorithm style representation that did not allow
                 branching in the antenna arms; the second used a
                 genetic programming style tree-structured
                 representation that allowed branching in the antenna
                 arms. The highest performance antennas from both
                 algorithms were fabricated and tested, and both yielded
                 very similar performance. Both antennas were comparable
                 in performance to a hand-designed antenna produced by
                 the antenna contractor for the mission, and so we
                 consider them examples of human-competitive performance
                 by evolutionary algorithms. As of this writing, one of

                 adapting a set of created designs to a change in
                 requirements. Previously we presented two four-arm,
                 symmetric, evolved antennas for NASA's Space Technology
                 5 mission. However, the mission's orbital vehicle was
                 changed, putting it into a much lower earth orbit,
                 changing the specifications for the mission. With
                 minimal changes to our evolutionary system, mostly in
                 the fitness function, we were able to evolve antennas
                 for the new mission requirements and, within one month
                 of this change, two new antennas were designed and
                 prototyped. Both antennas were tested and both had
                 acceptable performance compared with the new
                 specifications. This rapid response shows that
                 evolutionary design processes are able to accommodate
                 new requirements quickly and with minimal human
                 effort.",

  abstract =     "This paper investigates the application of genetic
                 programming to problems in industrial analog
                 computer-aided design (CAD). One CAD subdomain,
                 analogue structural synthesis, is an often-cited
                 success within the genetic programming (GP) literature,
                 yet industrial use remains elusive. We examine why this
                 is, by drawing upon our own experiences in bringing
                 analogue CAD tools into industrial use. In sum,
                 GP-synthesised designs need to be more robust in very
                 specific ways. When robustness is considered, a GP
                 methodology of today on a reasonable circuit problem
                 would take 150 years on a 1,000-node 1-GHz cluster.
                 Moore's Law cannot help either, because the problem
                 itself is 'Anti-Mooreware' -- it becomes more difficult
                 as Moore's Law progresses. However, we believe the
                 problem is still approachable with GP; it will just
                 take a significant amount of 'algorithm
                 engineering'.

                 We go on to describe the recent application of GP to
                 two other analogue CAD subdomains: symbolic modelling
                 and behavioural modeling. In contrast to structural
                 synthesis, they are easier from a GP perspective, but
                 are already at a level such that they can be exploited
                 in industry. Not only is GP the only approach that
                 gives interpretable SPICE-accurate nonlinear models, it
                 turns out to outperform nine other popular blackbox
                 approaches in a set of six circuit modeling problems.",

                 automated structural design. Furthermore, it uses
                 trustworthiness tradeoffs to handle addition of novelty
                 in a trackable fashion. It uses a multi-objective
                 algorithm with an age-layered population structure to
                 avoid premature convergence. While the application here
                 is analog circuit design, the methodology is general

                 modeling. Darwin's theory of natural selection can be
                 viewed as an algorithm for evolving fit organisms, with
                 fit in this context meaning survivable. The insight of
                 evolutionary computation is that the same algorithm can
                 be applied to populations of problem solutions, with
                 the fitness metric being defined so as to suit the
                 requirements of the user. Subsequent advances in
                 evolutionary theory can then be viewed as algorithm
                 refinements, worthy of evaluation for possible
                 inclusion in the method. Applications in ecological
                 modeling range from tuning parameters of predefined
                 models to fit the data, through generating predictive
                 and/or explanatory models directly from the data, to
                 modeling the coevolutionary processes in ecological
                 systems. The original systems, evolution strategies and
                 genetic algorithms (GAs), have since been joined by a
                 family of related algorithms, notably classifier
                 systems, genetic programming, messy GAs, estimation of
                 distribution algorithms, ant colony and particle swarm

                 The development of an entire organism from a single
                 cell is one of the most profound and awe inspiring
                 phenomena in the whole of the natural world. The
                 complexity of living systems itself dwarfs anything
                 that man has produced. This is all the more the case
                 for the processes that lead to these intricate systems.
                 In each phase of the development of a multi-cellular
                 being, this living system has to survive, whether
                 stand-alone or supported by various structures and
                 processes provided by other living systems. Organisms
                 construct themselves, out of humble single-celled
                 beginnings, riding waves of interaction between the
                 information residing in their genomes inherited from
                 the evolutionary past of their species via their
                 progenitors and the resources of their environment.",

  abstract =     "Human genetics is undergoing an information explosion.
                 The availability of chip-based technology facilitates
                 the measurement of thousands of DNA sequence variation
                 from across the human genome. The challenge is to sift
                 through these high-dimensional datasets to identify
                 combinations of interacting DNA sequence variations
                 that are predictive of common diseases. The goal of
                 this study is to develop and evaluate a genetic
                 programming (GP) approach to attribute selection and
                 classification in this domain. We simulated genetic
                 datasets of varying size in which the disease model
                 consists of two interacting DNA sequence variations
                 that exhibit no independent effects on class (i.e.
                 epistasis). We show that GP is no better than a simple
                 random search when classification accuracy is used as
                 the fitness function. We then show that including
                 pre-processed estimates of attribute quality using
                 Tuned ReliefF (TuRF) in a multi-objective fitness
                 function that also includes accuracy significantly
                 improves the performance of GP over that of random
                 search. This study demonstrates that GP may be a useful
                 computational discovery tool in this domain. This study
                 raises important questions about the general utility of
                 GP for these types of problems, the importance of data
                 pre-processing, the ideal functional form of the
                 fitness function, and the importance of expert
                 knowledge. We anticipate this study will provide an
                 important baseline for future studies investigating the
                 usefulness of GP as a general computational discovery
                 tool for large-scale genetic studies.",

                 solving complex problems in human genetics.
                 Unfortunately, many of these methods are not accessible
                 to biologists. This is partly due to the complexity of
                 the algorithms that limit their ready adoption and
                 integration into an analysis or modelling paradigm that
                 might otherwise only use univariate statistical
                 methods. This is also partly due to the lack of
                 user-friendly, open-source, platform-independent, and
                 freely-available software packages that are designed to
                 be used by biologists for routine analysis. It is our
                 objective to develop, distribute and support a
                 comprehensive software package that puts powerful GP
                 methods for genetic analysis in the hands of
                 geneticists. It is our working hypothesis that the most
                 effective use of such a software package would result
                 from interactive analysis by both a biologist and a
                 computer scientist (i.e. human-human-computer
                 interaction). We present here the design and
                 implementation of an open-source software package
                 called Symbolic Modeler (SyMod) that seeks to
                 facilitate geneticist -- bioinformaticist -- computer
                 interactions for problem solving in human genetics. We
                 present and discuss the results of an application of
                 SyMod to real data and discuss the challenges
                 associated with delivering a user-friendly GP-based

                 genetic programming in the automatic synthesis of
                 microcontroller assembly language programs that
                 implement strategies for time optimal or sub-optimal
                 control of the system to be controlled, based on
                 mathematical modelling through dynamic equations. One
                 of the difficulties presented by the conventional
                 design of optimal control systems lies in the fact that
                 solutions to problems of this type normally involve a
                 highly non-linear function of the system s state
                 variables. As a result, it is often not possible to
                 find an exact mathematical solution. As for the
                 implementation of the controller, there arises the
                 difficulty of programming the microcontroller manually
                 in order to execute the desired control. The research
                 that has been done in the area of automatic synthesis
                 of assembly language programs for microcontrollers
                 through genetic programming is surveyed in this chapter
                 and a novel methodology in which assembly language
                 programs are automatically synthesised, based on
                 mathematical modeling through dynamic plant equations,
                 is introduced. The methodology is evaluated in two case
                 studies: the cart-centering problem and the inverted
                 pendulum problem. The control performance of the
                 synthesised programs is compared with that of the
                 systems obtained by means of a tree-based genetic
                 programming method. The synthesised programs proved to
                 perform at least as well, but they had the additional
                 advantage of supplying the solution already in the
                 final format of the implementation platform selected: a

                 recombination of strings. In order to be numerically
                 tractable, the probability distribution has to be
                 factored into a small number of factors. Each factor
                 should depend on a small number of variables only. For

  abstract =     "This chapter describes recent advances in genetic
                 programming of machine code. Evolutionary program
                 induction of binary machine code is one of the fastest
                 1 GP methods and the most well studied linear approach.
                 The technique has previously been known as Compiling
                 Genetic Programming System (CGPS) but to avoid
                 confusion with methods using an actual compiler and to
                 separate the system from the method, the name has been
                 changed to Automatic Induction of Machine Code with
                 Genetic Programming (AIM-GP). AIM-GP stores individuals
                 as a linear string of native binary machine code, which
                 is directly executed by the processor. The absence of
                 an interpreter and complex memory handling allows
                 increased speed of several orders of magnitudes. AIM-GP
                 has so far been applied to processors with a fixed
                 instruction length (RISC) using integer arithmetics.
                 This chapter describes several new advances to the
                 AIM-GP method which are important for the applicability
                 of the technique. Such advances include enabling the
                 induction of code for CISC processors such as the most
                 widespread computer architecture INTEL x86 as well as
                 JAVA and many embedded processors. The new technique
                 also makes AIM-GP more portable in general and
                 simplifies the adaptation to any processor
                 architecture. Other additions include the use of
                 floating point instructions, control flow instructions,
                 ADFs and new genetic operators e.g. aligned homologous
                 crossover. We also discuss the benefits and drawbacks
                 of register machine GP versus tree-based GP. This
                 chapter is meant to be a directed towards the
                 practitioner, who wants to extend AIM-GP to new
                 architectures and application domains.",

                 production rule that decides the next proliferation
                 from the previous one is expressed by the rule-matrix.
                 By iterating the rule-matrix, a rule-tree and a
                 corresponding geometrical configuration are
                 investigated. Finally, various geometrical patterns of
                 configuration are obtained by the rule-matrix. We have
                 proposed a procedure for designing a rule-matrix from a

                 become an indispensable process for many image analysis
                 or computer vision systems. In this chapter, we discuss
                 how Genetic Programming (GP), a form of evolutionary
                 search, can be used to automatically synthesise image
                 operators that detect such features on digital images.
                 The experimental results we review, confirm that
                 artificial evolution can produce solutions that
                 outperform many man-made designs. Moreover, we argue
                 that GP is able to discover, and reuse, small code
                 fragments, or building blocks, that facilitate the
                 synthesis of image operators for point detection.
                 Another noteworthy result is that the GP did not
                 produce operators that rely on the auto-correlation
                 matrix, a mathematical concept that some have
                 considered to be the most appropriate to solve the
                 point detection task. Hence, the GP generates operators
                 that are conceptually simple and can still achieve a
                 high performance on standard tests.",

                 the style of GP. In separate versions they employ
                 either GP's crossover operator or a mutation operator.
                 The comparisons in terms of likelihood of success and
                 efficiency show them to be effective. Based upon their
                 success, hybrid versions of GP and hill climbing are
                 designed that improve upon a canonical version of GP.

                 algorithm composed by several key elements, which can
                 be modified and/or extended to generate new and better
                 rule induction algorithms. With this in mind, this work
                 proposes the use of a grammar-based genetic programming
                 (GGP) algorithm to automatically discover new
                 sequential covering algorithms. The proposed system is
                 evaluated using 20 data sets, and the
                 automatically-discovered rule induction algorithms are
                 compared with four well-known human-designed rule
                 induction algorithms. Results showed that the GGP
                 system is a promising approach to effectively discover
                 new sequential covering algorithms.",

                 successfully applied for a practical case where this
                 type of distributed generation can be installed. The
                 classic method used to estimate the capacity of a mini
                 hydro plant was also introduced and then time series
                 forecasting techniques were applied in order to enhance
                 the historic data available. Based on the results of
                 these forecast techniques and the available historical
                 data, an estimation of the design water flow was
                 performed, and a possible capacity for a mini hydro

  abstract =     "A possible goal in robust design of dynamic systems is
                 to find a system topology under which the sensitivity
                 of performance to the values of component parameters is
                 minimised. This can provide robust performance in the
                 face of environmental change (resistance variation with
                 temperature, for example) and/or manufacturing-induced
                 variability in parameter values. In some cases, a
                 topology that is relatively insensitive to parameter
                 variation may allow use of less expensive (looser
                 tolerance) components. Cost of components, in some
                 instances, also depends on whether 'standard-sized'
                 components may be used or custom values are required.
                 This is true whether the components are electrical
                 components, mechanical fasteners, or hydraulic
                 fittings. However, using only standardsized or
                 preferred-value components introduces an additional
                 design constraint. This chapter uses genetic
                 programming to develop bond graphs specifying component
                 topology and parameter values for an example task,
                 designing a passive analog low pass filter with
                 fifth-order Bessel characteristics. It explores three
                 alternative design approaches. The first uses
                 'standard' GP and evolves designs in which components
                 can take on arbitrary values (i.e., custom design). The
                 second approach adds random noise to each parameter and
                 evaluates each design ten times; then, at the end of
                 the evolution, for the best design found, it 'snaps'
                 its parameter values to a small (component specific)
                 set of standard values. The third approach uses only
                 the small set of allowable standard values throughout
                 the evolutionary process, evaluating each design ten
                 times after addition of noise to each standard
                 parameter value. Then the best designs emerging from
                 each of these three procedures are compared for
                 robustness to parameter variation, evaluating each of
                 them one hundred times with random perturbations of
                 their parameters. Results indicated that, for this
                 preliminary study, the third method produced the most
                 robust designs, and the second method was better than
                 the first.",

  abstract =     "Genetic programming has been used by Koza and many
                 others to design electrical, mechanical, and
                 mechatronic systems, including systems with both active
                 and passive components. This work has often required
                 large population sizes (on the order of ten thousand)
                 and millions of design evaluations to allow evolution
                 of both the topology and parameters of interesting
                 systems. For several years, the authors have studied
                 the evolution of multi-domain engineering systems
                 represented as bond graphs, a form that provides a
                 unified representation of mechanical, electrical,
                 hydraulic, pneumatic, thermal, and other systems in a
                 unified representation. Using this approach, called the
                 Genetic Programming/Bond Graph (GPBG) approach, they
                 have tried to evolve systems with perhaps tens of
                 components, but looking at only 100,000 or fewer design
                 candidates. The GPBG system uses much smaller
                 population sizes, but seeks to maintain diverse search
                 by using sustained evolutionary search processes such
                 as the Hierarchical Fair Competition principle and its
                 derivatives. It uses stochastic setting of parameter
                 values (resistances, capacitances, etc.) as a means of
                 evolving more robust designs. However, in past work,
                 the GPBG system was able to model and simulate only
                 passive components and simple (voltage or current, in
                 the case of electrical systems) sources, which severely
                 restricted the domain of problems it could address.
                 Thus, this paper reports the first steps in enhancing
                 the system to include active components. To date, only
                 three models of a transistor and one model of an
                 operational amplifier (op amp) are analysed and
                 implemented as two-port bond graph components. The
                 analysis method and design strategy can be easily
                 extended to other models or other active components or
                 even multi-port components. This chapter describes
                 design of an active analog low-pass filter with
                 fifth-order Bessel characteristics. A passive filter
                 with the same characteristics is also evolved with
                 GPBG. Then the best designs emerging from each of these
                 two procedures are compared. [The runs reported here
                 are intended only to document that the analysis tools
                 are working, and to begin study of the effects of
                 stochasticity, but not to determine the power of the
                 design procedure. The initial runs did not use HFC or
                 structure fitness sharing, which will be included as
                 soon as possible. Suitable problems will be tackled,
                 and results with suitable numbers of replicates to
                 allow drawing of statistically valid conclusions will
                 be reported in this paper, to determine whether
                 interesting circuits can be evolved more efficiently in
                 this framework than using other GP approaches.]",

                 Koza, 1994; Banzhaf et al., 1998] is usually seen as
                 quite demanding from the computation load and memory
                 use point of view. So, over the years a number of ideas
                 on how to improve GP performance have been proposed in
                 the literature. We recall the main speedup techniques
                 published to date in Section 13.2. Some of these
                 techniques are now used in many GP implementations.
                 Thanks to this and to the fact that the power of our
                 workstations is increasing exponentially (today's CPUs
                 are now more than 10 times faster than those used in
                 early GP work), nowadays we can run 50 generations a
                 typical GP benchmark problem with a population of 500
                 individuals in perhaps ten seconds on a normal
                 workstation. Nonetheless, the demand for more and more
                 efficient implementations has not stopped. This is
                 because extensive experimental GP studies (like
                 [Langdon and Poli, 1998] or [Luke and Spector, 1998])
                 and complex applications (like [Poli, 1996]",

                 a high degree of parallelism and an efficient and
                 effective reuse of partial results. Programs are
                 represented in PDGP as graphs with nodes representing
                 functions and terminals, and links representing the
                 flow of control and results. In the simplest form of
                 PDGP links are directed and unlabelled, in which case
                 PDGP can be considered a generalisation of standard GP.
                 However, more complex representations can be used,
                 which allow the exploration of a large space of
                 possible programs including standard tree-like
                 programs, logic networks, neural networks, recurrent
                 transition networks, finite state automata, etc. In

                 correctness of the offspring. For this reason PDGP

                 computers to automatically solve problems without
                 having to tell them explicitly how to do it. Since its
                 inception, GP has been used to solve many practical
                 problems, producing a number of human competitive
                 results and even patentable new inventions. We start
                 with a gentle introduction to the basic representation,
                 initialisation and operators used in GP, complemented
                 by a step by step description of their use for the
                 solution of an illustrative problem. We then progress
                 to discuss a variety of alternative representations for
                 programs and more advance specialisations of GP. A
                 multiplicity of real-world applications of GP are then
                 presented to illustrate the scope of the technique. For
                 the benefits of more advanced readers, this is followed
                 by a series of recommendations and suggestions to
                 obtain the most from a GP system. Although the chapter

  abstract =     "Numerous models of modern and ancient urban landscapes
                 have been proposed. While is of interest to classify
                 examples of early urban centres, it is even more
                 interesting to model their origins. Since these
                 emergent centers can be viewed not only as adaptations
                 to their social and biological environments, but also
                 as a source of further change. Thus, the meaning or
                 semantics of an emergent centre reflects the processes
                 by which it was formed. In the study of one ancient
                 centre, Monte Alban, we have used data mining
                 techniques to extract a large number of decision trees
                 describing its settlement over time. Each decision tree
                 specifies the values for selected attributes that can
                 predict settlement activity in the terraces that
                 comprise the site. However, not all terraces with those
                 properties are occupied in the same way. This can
                 result from economic or social reasons. Also, the
                 variables employed do not always have the semantics
                 needed to make sense of the distinction between
                 occupied and unoccupied terraces. In this paper we
                 focus on the latter reason. Here, GP and CA are used to
                 add semantics to rules to make them more understandable
                 to experts in the area. Future work will examine how GP
                 can be used to integrate social and economic
                 constraints in with the basic decision tree rules.",

  abstract =     "Genetic programming has long been known as a
                 computationally expensive optimisation technique. When
                 evolving imaging operations, the processing time
                 increases dramatically. This work describes a system
                 using a caching mechanism which reduces the number of
                 evaluations needed by up to 66 percent, counteracting
                 the effects of increasing tree size. This results in a
                 decrease in elapsed time of up to 52 percent. A cost
                 threshold is introduced which can guarantee a speed
                 increase. This caching technique allows genetic
                 programming to be feasibly applied to problems in
                 computer vision and image processing. The tradeoffs
                 involved in caching are analysed, and the use of the
                 technique on a previously time consuming medical
                 segmentation problem is shown.",

                 interaction with an environment is defining a good
                 representation, that is a representation which captures
                 the underlying structure and functionality of the
                 domain. This chapter discusses an extension of the
                 genetic programming (GP) paradigm based on the idea
                 that subroutines obtained from blocks of good
                 representations act as building blocks and may enable a
                 faster evolution of even better representations. This
                 GP extension algorithm is called adaptive
                 representation through learning (ARL). It has built-in
                 mechanisms for (1) creation of new subroutines through
                 discovery and generalization of blocks of code; (2)
                 deletion of subroutines. The set of evolved subroutines
                 extracts common knowledge emerging during the
                 evolutionary process and acquires the necessary
                 structure for solving the problem. ARL was successfully
                 tested on the problem of controlling an agent in a
                 dynamic and non-deterministic environment. Results with
                 the automatic discovery of subroutines show the
                 potential to better scale up the GP technique to
                 complex problems.",

                 interpretation of how Genetic Programming (GP)
                 constructs solutions, based on the rooted-tree schema
                 concept.

                 A rooted-tree schema is a simple relation on the space
                 of tree-shaped structures which provides a quantifiable
                 partitioning of the search space. Formal manipulation
                 of rooted-tree schemata allows: (1) The role of the
                 size in the selection and survival of evolved
                 expressions to be made explicit; (2) The
                 interrelationship between parsimony penalty, size, and
                 fitness of evolved expressions to be clarified and
                 better understood; (3) The introduction of alternative
                 approaches to evolving parsimonious solutions by
                 preventing rooted-tree schema from bloating.

                 The rooted-tree schema concept provides a top-down
                 perspective of how program expressions are evolved,
                 contrary to the common belief that small pieces of
                 code, or building blocks, are gradually assembled to
                 create solutions. Analysis shows that GP, while it
                 improves solutions, combines both bottom-up and
                 top-down refinement strategies.",

                 demonstrated to yield a significantly better

                 programming libraries as they provide a suite of
                 functions that can not only be used across several runs
                 on a particular problem, but also to aid in the scaling
                 of a system to more difficult instances of a problem.
                 This is achieved by training a library on a relatively
                 simple instance of a problem before applying it to the
                 more difficult one.

                 The chapter examines the dynamics of the library
                 internals, and how functions compete for dominance of
                 the library. We demonstrate that the libraries tend to

  abstract =     "In control engineering, it is well known that many
                 physical processes exhibit a chaotic component. In
                 point of fact, it is also assumed that conventional
                 modeling procedures disregard it, as stochastic noise,
                 beside nonlinear universal approximators (like neural
                 networks, fuzzy rule-based or genetic programming-based
                 models,) can capture the chaotic nature of the process.
                 In this chapter we will show that this is not always
                 true. Despite the nonlinear capabilities of the
                 universal approximators, these methods optimize the one
                 step prediction of the model. This is not the most
                 adequate objective function for a chaotic model,
                 because there may exist many different nonchaotic
                 processes that have near zero prediction error for such
                 an horizon. The learning process will surely converge
                 to one of them. Unless we include in the objective
                 function some terms that depend on the properties on
                 the reconstructed attractor, we may end up with a non
                 chaotic model. Therefore, we propose to follow a
                 multiobjective approach to model chaotic processes, and
                 we also detail how to apply either genetic algorithms
                 or simulated annealing to obtain a difference
                 equations-based model.",

  abstract =     "A learner's modifiable components are called its
                 policy. An algorithm that modifies the policy is a
                 learning algorithm. If the learning algorithm has
                 modifiable components represented as part of the
                 policy, then we speak of a self-modifying policy (SMP).
                 SMPs can modify the way they modify themselves etc.
                 They are of interest in situations where the initial
                 learning algorithm itself can be improved by experience
                 -- this is what we call ``learning to learn''. How can
                 we force some (stochastic) SMP to trigger better and
                 better self-modifications? The success-story algorithm
                 (SSA) addresses this question in a lifelong
                 reinforcement learning context. During the learner's
                 life-time, SSA is occasionally called at times computed
                 according to SMP itself. SSA uses backtracking to undo
                 those SMP-generated SMP-modifications that have not
                 been empirically observed to trigger lifelong reward
                 accelerations (measured up until the current SSA call
                 -- this evaluates the long-term effects of
                 SMP-modifications setting the stage for later
                 SMP-modifications). SMP-modifications that survive SSA
                 represent a lifelong success history. Until the next
                 SSA call, they build the basis for additional
                 SMP-modifications. Solely by self-modifications our
                 SMP/SSA-based learners solve a complex task in a
                 partially observable environment (POE) whose state

                 are. I study an embedded active learner that can limit
                 its predictions to almost arbitrary computable aspects
                 of spatio-temporal events. It constructs probabilistic
                 algorithms that (1) control interaction with the world,
                 (2) map event sequences to abstract internal
                 representations (IRs), (3) predict IRs from IRs
                 computed earlier. Its goal is to create novel
                 algorithms generating IRs useful for correct IR
                 predictions, without wasting time on those learned
                 before. This requires an adaptive novelty measure which
                 is implemented by a co-evolutionary scheme involving
                 two competing modules collectively designing (initially
                 random) algorithms representing experiments. Using
                 special instructions, the modules can bet on the
                 outcome of IR predictions computed by algorithms they
                 have agreed upon. If their opinions differ then the
                 system checks who's right, punishes the loser (the
                 surprised one), and rewards the winner. An evolutionary
                 or reinforcement learning algorithm forces each module
                 to maximise reward. This motivates both modules to lure
                 each other into agreeing upon experiments involving
                 predictions that surprise it. Since each module
                 essentially can veto experiments it does not consider
                 profitable, the system is motivated to focus on those
                 computable aspects of the environment where both
                 modules still have confident but different opinions.
                 Once both share the same opinion on a particular issue
                 (via the loser's learning process, e.g., the winner is
                 simply copied onto the loser), the winner loses a
                 source of reward -- an incentive to shift the focus of
                 interest onto novel experiments. My simulations include
                 an example where surprise-generation of this kind helps
                 to speed up external reward.",

  abstract =     "This chapter illustrates the potential of genetic
                 programming (GP) in the field of macro-mechanical
                 modeling, addressing the problem of identification of a
                 mechanical model for a material. Two kinds of models
                 are considered. One-dimensional dynamic models are
                 represented via symbolic formulations termed {\em
                 rheological models}, which are directly evolved by GP.
                 Three-dimensional static models of hyperelastic
                 materials are expressed in terms of strain energy
                 functions. A model is rated based on the distance
                 between the behavior predicted by the model, and the
                 actual behavior of the material given by a set of
                 mechanical experiments. The choice of GP is motivated
                 by strong arguments, relying on the tree-structure of
                 rheological models in the first case, and on the need
                 for first and second order derivatives in the second
                 case. Key issues are the exploration of viable
                 individuals only, and the use of Gaussian mutations to
                 optimize numerical constants.",

  abstract =     "In this chapter evolutionary based design/optimisation
                 approaches has been proposed for controller design of
                 continuous-time process control. Parameters of
                 controllers with fixed defined internal structure are
                 designed as well as controllers with a-priori unknown
                 internal structure and its parameters. The presented
                 approaches minimise a cost function, which comprises
                 closed-loop system simulation and performance index
                 evaluation. In this way the controller design is
                 transformed into a search problem in the n-dimensional
                 parameter space. The design/optimisation can be carried
                 out for complex systems and control structures of
                 various types. The main and practically the only
                 limitation of the approach is the time consuming
                 computation (compared with conventional approaches) due
                 to thousands up to ten thousands closed-loop
                 simulations needed by each design procedure. From the
                 point of view the user, on the other hand, the design
                 method is simple to use. It transfers the design effort
                 from the experienced human designer to the computer.
                 The design approach is simple to extend to robust
                 controller design, for which two different methods have
                 been proposed. In addition statistical robustness
                 measure has been introduced, which can be considered as
                 an objective tool for robust controller performance
                 comparison. Next, the design idea has been extended
                 also to a multi-objective design task, where the
                 objective is the search for the Pareto-optimal set of
                 solutions. From these solutions the designer can choose
                 the representative, which is the most appropriate in
                 the particular case. Finally the design goal was
                 extended from a fix defined controller structure with
                 unknown controller parameters to the
                 search/optimisation of the unknown internal structure
                 of the controller. From that reason, the Genetic
                 Programming has been used. The proposed
                 evolutionary-based methods can be used for design of
                 various types of controllers for various system types
                 (linear, non-linear, stable, unstable, SISO and MIMO,
                 fuzzy, neural, etc.). The only condition of this
                 approach is that there exists a simulation model of the
                 designed closed-loop. In the future, this design
                 approach will be extended for solving very complex
                 design tasks in the process control area like complex
                 MIMO control systems for non-linear continuous-time
                 systems and for robotic applications using parallel
                 evolutionary algorithms.",

                 test cases optimally require more computation cycles
                 than others. Therefore, programs must dynamically
                 allocate cycles among test cases in order to use
                 computation time efficiently. To elicit the strategic
                 allocation of computation time, we impose an {\it
                 aggregate computation time ceiling} that applies over a
                 series of fitness cases. This exerts time pressure on
                 evolved programs, with the effect that resulting

                 opportunistically spending less time per test case when
                 possible, with minimal damage to domain performance.
                 This technique is in principle extensible to resources

                 together several concepts: chaos, complexity,
                 evolution, self propagating entities, and the nature of
                 life itself. This botanical form of life, reproducing
                 itself from planet to planet through space, is in many
                 ways analogous to other self replicating systems
                 including organisms, entire species, or even ideas. A
                 window into this system, replicating on a grander
                 scale, is meant to increase awareness of self
                 propagating systems in general, as well as inspire
                 thoughts about our entire planet of life as a whole
                 entity.",

  abstract =     "Symbolic regression via genetic programming
                 (hereafter, referred to simply as symbolic regression)
                 has proved to be a very important tool for industrial
                 empirical modelling (Kotanchek et al., 2003). Two of
                 the primary problems with industrial use of symbolic
                 regression are (1) the relatively large computational
                 demands in comparison with other nonlinear empirical
                 modeling techniques such as neural networks and (2) the
                 difficulty in making the trade-off between expression
                 accuracy and complexity. The latter issue is
                 significant since, in general, we prefer parsimonious
                 (simple) expressions with the expectation that they are
                 more robust with respect to changes over time in the
                 underlying system or extrapolation outside the range of
                 the data used as the reference in evolving the symbolic
                 regression.

                 In this chapter, we present a genetic programming
                 variant, Pareto GP, which exploits the Pareto front to
                 dramatically speed the symbolic regression solution
                 evolution as well as explicitly exploit the
                 complexity-performance trade-off. In addition to the
                 improvement in evolution efficiency, the Pareto front
                 perspective allows the user to choose appropriate
                 models for further analysis or deployment. The Pareto
                 front avoids the need to a priori specify a trade-off
                 between competing objectives (e.g. complexity and
                 performance) by identifying the curve (or surface or
                 hyper-surface) which characterises, for example, the
                 best performance for a given expression complexity.",

                 University of Michigan organised the first Genetic
                 Programming Theory and Practice Workshop to bring
                 together practitioners and theorists to bridge the gap
                 between what practicioners were doing and what
                 theorists were studying. In the introductory chapter of
                 that volume the authors described Genetic Programming
                 (GP) as a young art that is just beginning to make its
                 way into applications programming in a serious way
                 (Riolo and Worzel, 2004). Five years later GP is still
                 a relatively young field, but it is rapidly maturing
                 and has produced a substantial track record of
                 significant successes on large-scale, real world
                 applications. However, these successes are still
                 generally achieved by researchers with significant
                 expert knowledge of GP; successful application of GP to
                 large scale problems remains out of the reach of
                 novices. The lack of a rigorous, detailed theory that
                 is mature enough to guide the development of GP systems
                 to solve specific problems contributes to this
                 weakness. Thus, there remains an on-going need to both
                 strengthen theory and to keep it closely tied to the
                 practice of GP. The Genetic Programming Theory and
                 Practice Workshops remain focused on this goal.",

                 promising approach for training agents in heterogeneous
                 multi-agent systems. However, research in evolving
                 teams (or ensembles) has proven that common
                 evolutionary approaches have subtle, but significant,
                 weaknesses when it comes to balancing member
                 performance and member cooperation. In addition, there
                 are potentially significant scaling problems in
                 applying evolutionary techniques to very large
                 multi-agent systems. It is impractical to train each
                 member of a large system individually, but purely
                 homogeneous teams are inadequate. Previously we
                 proposed Orthogonal Evolution of Teams (OET) as a novel

                 evolutionary techniques and OET on the problem of
                 evolving multi-agent systems, specifically a landscape
                 exploration problem with heterogeneous agents, and
                 examine the ability of the algorithms to evolve teams
                 that are scalable in the number of team members. Our
                 results confirm that the more traditional evolutionary
                 approaches suffer the same weakness with multi-agent
                 systems as they do with teams and that OET does
                 compensate for these weaknesses. In addition, the three
                 algorithms show distinctly different scaling behaviour,
                 with OET scaling significantly better than the two more
                 traditional approaches.",

                 can be used to simultaneously evolve programs and their
                 control structures. Koza has previously shown that the
                 performance of a genetic programming system can
                 sometimes be improved by allowing for the simultaneous
                 evolution of a main program and a collection of
                 automatically defined functions (ADFs). This chapter
                 shows how related techniques can be used to
                 simultaneously evolve a main program and a collection
                 of automatically defined macros (ADMs). Examples are
                 provided to show how the use of ADMs can lead to the
                 production of useful new control structures during
                 evolution, and data is presented to show that ADMs
                 sometimes provide a greater benefit than do ADFs. The
                 chapter includes a discussion of characteristics of
                 problems that may benefit most from the use of ADMs or
                 from architectures that include both ADFs and ADMs. It
                 is suggested that ADMs are likely to be useful for
                 evolving intelligent action systems for complex
                 environments, and data is presented to show that this
                 is the case for one such application. The chapter

  abstract =     "Quantum computers are computational devices that use
                 the dynamics of atomic-scale objects to store and
                 manipulate information. Only a few, small-scale quantum
                 computers have been built to date, but quantum
                 computers can in principle outperform all possible
                 classical computers in significant ways. Quantum
                 computation is therefore a subject of considerable
                 theoretical interest that may also have practical
                 applications in the future.

                 Genetic programming can automatically discover new
                 algorithms for quantum computers [spector:1998:GPqc].
                 We describe how to simulate a quantum computer so that
                 the fitness of a quantum algorithm can be determined on
                 classical hardware. We then describe ways in which
                 three different genetic programming approaches can
                 drive the simulator to evolve new quantum algorithms.
                 The approaches are standard tree-based genetic
                 programming, stack-based linear genome genetic
                 programming, and stackless linear genome genetic
                 programming. We demonstrate the techniques on four
                 different problems: the two-bit early promise problem,
                 the scaling majority-on problem, the four-item database
                 search problem, and the two-bit and-or problem. For
                 three of these problems (all but majority-on) the
                 automatically discovered algorithms are more efficient
                 than any possible classical algorithms for the same
                 problems. One of the better-than-classical algorithms
                 (for the two-bit and-or problem) is in fact more
                 efficient than any previously known quantum algorithm
                 for the same problem, suggesting that genetic
                 programming may be a valuable tool in the future study
                 of quantum programming.",

                 genetic operators that are applied according to
                 user-specified parameters. Because it is unlikely that
                 the provided operators or the default parameters will
                 be ideal for all problems or all program
                 representations, practitioners often devote
                 considerable energy to experimentation with
                 alternatives. Attempts to bring choices about operators
                 and parameters under evolutionary control, through
                 self-adaptative algorithms or meta-genetic programming,
                 have been explored in the literature and have produced
                 interesting results. However, no systems based on such
                 principles have yet been demonstrated to have greater
                 practical problem-solving power than the more-standard
                 alternatives. This chapter explores the prospects for
                 extending the practical power of genetic programming
                 through the refinement of an approach called
                 autoconstructive evolution, in which the algorithms
                 used for the reproduction and variation of evolving
                 programs are encoded in the programs themselves, and
                 are thereby subject to variation and evolution in
                 tandem with their problem-solving components. We
                 present the motivation for the autoconstructive
                 evolution approach, show how it can be instantiated
                 using the Push programming language, summarise previous
                 results with the Pushpop system, outline the more
                 recent AutoPush system, and chart a course for future
                 work focused on the production of practical systems
                 that can solve hard problems.",

                 least for literate humans. However, creating a good
                 character recognition program is not so simple---a
                 single character can have significant variability when
                 considered across many fonts. Some characters are
                 misleadingly similar, especially considering their
                 incarnations in multiple fonts. This paper discusses a
                 technique, as well as some pitfalls, for automatically
                 evolving optical character recognition programs using
                 genetic programming. The problem-specific information
                 required for this technique is a set of training
                 characters, e.g. { 0, {\ldots}, 9, a, {\ldots}, f}, and
                 GIF incarnations of those characters in different
                 fonts. The result is a set of algorithms that can
                 determine which character is represented by an image.
                 The algorithms can be applied to those images used to
                 evolve the algorithms, as well as new images that
                 represent one of the characters in a new font not seen
                 during evolution.",

                 practical sense (the largest number of qubits currently
                 in a quantum computer is 7), but a significant body of
                 physical scientists are at work on making quantum
                 computing a practical reality. If history repeats
                 itself, we will get small computers initially that will
                 grow as technology improves. Since quantum computers
                 seem capable of achieving results unachievable by other
                 means, exploiting effectively even limited hardware
                 platforms may bring significant economic benefits.

                 We now have an opportunity to build the application
                 infrastructure to run on quantum computers when they
                 eventually come on-stream. Several researchers have
                 developed new and important quantum algorithms over the
                 past decade, but there are fundamentally few distinct
                 quantum algorithms. In some ways novel application
                 development seems to have stalled.

                 Why is this? The authors of this review believe that
                 intuition about quantum phenomena and the nature of
                 quantum computation is too limited. It is such a
                 radically different arena, well outside the comfort
                 zone provided by traditional computation. If our
                 mindsets are the problem then we must seek to free
                 ourselves, or augment our current capabilities. Nature,
                 in the guise of quantum mechanical laws, provides us
                 with new computational capabilities. But Nature also is
                 good at invention; evolution is a form of continual
                 reinvention. In this chapter, we review how automated
                 search techniques inspired by biological systems can be
                 used to uncover new quantum circuits and algorithms.",

                 are simple mappings from the inputs to the correct
                 outputs; some kind of internal state or memory is
                 needed to operate well or optimally in these domains.
                 Traditionally, genetic programming has concentrated on
                 solving problems in the functional/reactive arena. This
                 may be due in part to the absence of a natural way to
                 incorporate memory into the paradigm. This chapter
                 proposes a simple, Turing-complete addition to the
                 genetic programming paradigm that seamlessly
                 incorporates the evolution of the effective gathering,
                 storage, and retrieval of arbitrarily complicated state
                 information. A new environment is presented and used to
                 evaluate this addition to the paradigm. Experimental
                 results show that the effective production and use of
                 complex memory structures can be evolved and that
                 functions evolving the intelligent use of state quickly
                 and permanently displace purely reactive and
                 non-deterministic functions. These results may aid
                 future research into the causes and constituents of
                 mental models and are shown to open the field of
                 genetic programming to include all learning strategies

                 process act at random, without regard to how the
                 internal components of the programs to be recombined
                 behaved during training. This research introduces a

                 significantly more likely than random local sampling to

                 contribution of our research is a detailed approach by
                 which principled credit-blame assignment can be brought

                 determines the capability of evolutionary processes to
                 find complex solutions in which many variables
                 interact. The question is how good genetic
                 representations can be found and how they can be
                 adapted online to account for what can be learned about
                 the structure of the problem from previous samples. We
                 address these questions in a scenario that we term
                 indirect Estimation-of-Distribution: We consider a
                 decorrelated search distribution (mutational
                 variability) on a variable length genotype space. A
                 one-to-one encoding onto the phenotype space then needs
                 to induce an adapted phenotypic variability
                 incorporating the dependencies between phenotypic
                 variables that have been observed successful
                 previously. Formalizing this in the framework of
                 Estimation-of-Distribution Algorithms, an adapted
                 phenotypic variability can be characterized as
                 minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence to a
                 population of previously selected individuals
                 (parents). Our core result is a relation between the
                 Kullback-Leibler divergence and the description length
                 of the encoding in the specific scenario, stating that
                 compact codes provide a way to minimize this
                 divergence. A proposed class of Compression
                 Evolutionary Algorithms and preliminary experiments
                 with an L-system compression scheme illustrate the
                 approach. We also discuss the implications for the
                 self-adaptive evolution of genetic representations on
                 the basis of neutrality (s-evolution) towards compact
                 codes.",

                 salient regions on an image are of considerable

                 detection and recognition, image registration and
                 content-based image retrieval. A GP-based framework is
                 described where candidate image operators are

                 promotes the detection of stable and dispersed image
                 features, both of which are highly desirable
                 properties. After a significant number of experimental
                 runs, a plateau of maxima was identified within the

                 I wrote what is probably the first massively parallel
                 version of GP. It is in *Lisp for the CM-5. It uses
                 SIMD parallelism in the eval step, and is probably only

                 behaviour-based fuzzy control approach to autonomous
                 local navigation is presented here. A hierarchical
                 architecture is described which consists of multiple

                 decision or motion behaviour that contributes to a
                 dynamic map from stimuli to goal-oriented actions.
                 Synthesis of a behaviour hierarchy which combines
                 primitive motion behaviors to produce navigation
                 behaviours is discussed. This is coupled with a
                 technique for multi-behaviour coordination for which
                 fuzzy rule learning by genetic programming is applied.
                 The overall approach is verified by experimental

                 experiments, or spectral characterizations of organic
                 and inorganic samples). A pipelined approach using two

                 classification ability, and that of subsets of
                 attributes obtained after the mining process were
                 described in terms of analytic functions obtained by
                 genetic programming (gene expression programming), and
                 simplified using computer algebra systems. Visual data
                 mining techniques using virtual reality were used for
                 inspecting results. An exploration of this approach
                 (using Leukemia, Colon cancer and Breast cancer gene
                 expression data) was conducted in a series of
                 experiments. They led to small subsets of genes with
                 high discrimination power.",

                 characterise the fitness landscapes of real-life
                 Genetic Programming applications by means of a
                 predictive algebraic difficulty indicator. The
                 indicator used is the Negative Slope Coefficient, whose
                 efficacy has been recently empirically demonstrated on
                 a large set of hand-tailored theoretical test functions
                 and well known GP benchmarks. The real-life problems
                 studied belong to the field of Biomedical applications
                 and consist of automatically assessing a mathematical
                 relationship between a set of molecular descriptors
                 from a given dataset of drugs and some important
                 pharmacokinetic parameters. The parameters considered
                 here are Human Oral Bioavailability, Median Oral Lethal
                 Dose, and Plasma Protein Binding levels. The
                 availability of good prediction tools for
                 pharmacokinetics parameters like these is critical for
                 optimising the efficiency of therapies, maximising
                 medical success rate and minimizing toxic effects. The
                 experimental results presented in this chapter show
                 that the Negative Slope Coefficient seems to be a
                 reasonable tool to characterise the difficulty of these
                 problems, and can be used to choose the most effective
                 Genetic Programming configuration (fitness function,
                 representation, parameters' values) from a set of given

  abstract =     "Genetic programming (GP) is an evolutionary approach
                 that extends genetic algorithms to allow the
                 exploration of the space of computer programs. Like
                 other evolutionary algorithms, GP works by defining a
                 goal in the form of a quality criterion (or fitness)
                 and then using this criterion to evolve a set (or
                 population) of candidate solutions (individuals) by
                 mimicking the basic principles of Darwinian evolution.
                 GP breeds the solutions to problems using an iterative
                 process involving the probabilistic selection of the
                 fittest solutions and their variation by means of a set
                 of genetic operators, usually crossover and mutation.
                 GP has been successfully applied to a number of
                 challenging real-world problem domains. Its operations
                 and behaviour are now reasonably well understood thanks
                 to a variety of powerful theoretical results. In this
                 chapter, the main definitions and features of GP are
                 introduced and its typical operations are described.
                 Some of its applications are then surveyed. Some
                 important theoretical results in this field, including
                 some very recent ones, are reviewed and some of the
                 most challenging open issues and directions for future

  abstract =     "Better solutions faster is the reality of the
                 industrial modelling world, now more than ever.
                 Efficiency requirements, market pressures, and ever
                 changing data force us to use symbolic regression via
                 genetic programming (GP) in a highly automated fashion.
                 This is why we want our GP system to produce simple
                 solutions of the highest possible quality with the
                 lowest computational effort, and a high consistency in
                 the results of independent GP runs. In this chapter, we
                 show that genetic programming with a focus on ranking
                 in combination with goal softening is a very powerful
                 way to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the
                 evolutionary search. Our strategy consists of partial
                 fitness evaluations of individuals on random subsets of
                 the original data set, with a gradual increase in the
                 subset size in consecutive generations. From a series
                 of experiments performed on three test problems, we
                 observed that those evolutions that started from the
                 smallest subset sizes (10percent) consistently led to
                 results that are superior in terms of the goodness of
                 fit, consistency between independent runs, and
                 computational effort. Our experience indicates that
                 solutions obtained using this approach are also less
                 complex and more robust against over-fitting. We find
                 that the near-optimal strategy of allocating
                 computational budget over a GP run is to evenly
                 distribute it over all generations. This implies that
                 initially, more individuals can be evaluated using
                 small subset sizes, promoting better exploration.
                 Exploitation becomes more important towards the end of
                 the run, when all individuals are evaluated using the
                 full data set with correspondingly smaller population
                 sizes.",

  abstract =     "The ubiquitous presence of distributed systems has
                 drastically changed the way the world interacts, and
                 impacted not only the economics and governance but also
                 the society at large. It is therefore important for the
                 architecture and infrastructure within the distributed
                 environment to be continuously renewed in order to cope
                 with the rapid changes driven by the innovative
                 technologies. However, many problems in distributed
                 computing are either of dynamic nature, large scale, NP
                 complete, or a combination of any of these. In most
                 cases, exact solutions are hardly found. As a result, a
                 number of intelligent nature-inspired algorithms have
                 been used recently, as these algorithms are capable of
                 achieving good quality solutions in reasonable
                 computational time. Among all the nature-inspired
                 algorithms, evolutionary algorithms are considerably
                 the most extensively applied ones. This chapter
                 presents a systematic review of evolutionary algorithms
                 employed to solve various problems related to
                 distributed systems. The review is aimed at providing
                 an insight of evolutionary approaches, in particular
                 genetic algorithms and genetic programming, in solving
                 problems in five different areas of network
                 optimization: network topology, routing, protocol
                 synthesis, network security, and parameter settings and
                 configuration. Some interesting applications from these
                 areas will be discussed in detail with the use of
                 illustrative examples.",

                 have become accepted tools for developing
                 generalisations of large data sets, typically for use
                 with production rule systems in prediction and
                 classification. The advent of computer based
                 cartography and the field of geographic information
                 systems (GIS) has seen a wealth of spatial data
                 generated and used for decision making and modelling.
                 We examine the implications of inductive techniques
                 applied to geospatial data in a logical framework. It
                 is argued that spatial induction systems will benefit
                 from the ability to extend their initial representation
                 language, through feature and relation construction.
                 The enormous search spaces involved imply a need for
                 strong biasing techniques to control the generation of
                 possible representations of the data for all but the
                 most trivial of cases. A heavily constrained geospatial
                 domain, topographic representation, is described as one
                 simplified example of induction across a vector

                 problem. The basic cycle of a bipedal gait, called a

                 single-support phase and the double-support phase,

                 back to front position. In the double-support phase,
                 both feet simultaneously touch the ground, and the
                 weight of the robot is shifted from one foot to the
                 other. During the completion of a stride, the stability

  abstract =     "One of the most important and challenging areas of
                 research in evolutionary algorithms is to investigate
                 ways to successfully apply evolutionary algorithms to
                 larger and more complicated problems. One approach to
                 make a given problem more tractable is to discover
                 problem representations automatically. Koza (1993) uses
                 the even-n-parity problem to demonstrate extensively
                 that his approach of Automatic Function Definition
                 (ADF) can facilitate the solution of the problem.
                 Unfortunately, the solutions found by GP with ADF can
                 only solved the problem for a particular value of n. If
                 a different value of n is used, GP with ADF must be
                 used again to find other programs that can solve the
                 new even-n-parity problem. Clearly, the solution found
                 is not general enough to solve all even-n-parity
                 problem for n greater than or equal to zero. In this
                 paper, we apply GGP (Generic Genetic Programming) to
                 evolve general recursive functions for the
                 even-n-parity problem. GGP is very flexible and
                 programs in various programming languages can be
                 acquired. Moreover, it is powerful enough to represent
                 context-sensitive information and domain-dependent
                 knowledge. This knowledge can be used to accelerate the
                 learning speed and/or improve the quality of the
                 programs induced. A number of experiments have been
                 performed to determine the impact of domain-specific
                 knowledge on the speed of learning.",

  abstract =     "Hyper-heuristics represent a novel search methodology
                 that is motivated by the goal of automating the process
                 of selecting or combining simpler heuristics in order
                 to solve hard computational search problems. An
                 extension of the original hyper-heuristic idea is to
                 generate new heuristics which are not currently known.
                 These approaches operate on a search space of
                 heuristics rather than directly on a search space of
                 solutions to the underlying problem which is the case
                 with most meta-heuristics implementations. In the
                 majority of hyper-heuristic studies so far, a framework
                 is provided with a set of human designed heuristics,
                 taken from the literature, and with good measures of
                 performance in practice. A less well studied approach
                 aims to generate new heuristics from a set of potential
                 heuristic components. The purpose of this chapter is to
                 discuss this class of hyper-heuristics, in which
                 Genetic Programming is the most widely used
                 methodology. A detailed discussion is presented
                 including the steps needed to apply this technique,
                 some representative case studies, a literature review
                 of related work, and a discussion of relevant issues.
                 Our aim is to convey the exciting potential of this
                 innovative approach for automating the heuristic design
                 process.",

                 in classifying mesothelioma samples from baseline data
                 according to their time to recurrence. In this case
                 there are over 12000 inputs for each sample but only 19
                 samples to learn from. We reflect on the theoretical

                 cases and speculate on the nature of generality.",

                 approach re-expresses a recursive program using a
                 non-recursive application of a higher-order function.
                 It divides a program recursion pattern into two parts:
                 the recursion code and the application of the code.
                 With the higher-order functions handling recursion code
                 application, GP effort becomes focused on the
                 generation of recursion code.

                 We employed this method to evolve two recursive
                 programs: strstr C library function and programs that
                 produce the Fibonacci sequence. In both cases, the
                 program space defined by higher-order functions are
                 very easy for GP to find a solution. We have learned
                 about higher-order function selection and fitness
                 assignment through this study. The next step will be to

                 learning problem that appears in cases where knowledge
                 about training examples is incomplete. In this problem,
                 the teacher labels examples that are sets (also called
                 bags) of instances. The teacher does not label whether
                 an individual instance in a bag is positive or
                 negative. The learning algorithm needs to generate a
                 classifier that will correctly classify unseen examples
                 (i.e., bags of instances). This learning framework is
                 receiving growing attention in the machine learning
                 community and since it was introduced by Dietterich,
                 Lathrop, Lozano-Perez (1997), a wide range of tasks
                 have been formulated as multi-instance problems. Among
                 these tasks, we can cite content-based image retrieval
                 (Chen, Bi, & Wang, 2006) and annotation (Qi and Han,
                 2007), text categorisation (Andrews, Tsochantaridis, &
                 Hofmann, 2002), web index page recommendation (Zhou,
                 Jiang, & Li, 2005; Xue, Han, Jiang, & Zhou, 2007) and
                 drug activity prediction (Dietterich et al., 1997; Zhou
                 & Zhang, 2007). In this chapter we introduce MOG3P-MI,
                 a multiobjective grammar guided genetic programming
                 algorithm to handle multi-instance problems. In this
                 algorithm, based on SPEA2, individuals represent
                 classification rules which make it possible to
                 determine if a bag is positive or negative. The quality
                 of each individual is evaluated according to two
                 quality indexes: sensitivity and specificity. Both
                 these measures have been adapted to MIL circumstances.
                 Computational experiments show that the MOG3P-MI is a
                 robust algorithm for classification in different
                 domains where achieves competitive results and obtain
                 classifiers which contain simple rules which add

                 developing multiagent systems in the domains where
                 human programming alone is not sufficient to take into
                 account all the details of possible situations.
                 However, existing GP methods attempt to evolve
                 collective behavior immediately from primitive actions.
                 More realistic tasks require several emergent behaviors
                 and a proper coordination of these is essential for
                 success. We have recently proposed a framework, called
                 fitness switching, to facilitate learning to coordinate
                 composite emergent behaviors using genetic programming.
                 Coevolutionary fitness switching described in this
                 chapter extends our previous work by introducing the
                 concept of coevolution for more effective
                 implementation of fitness switching. Performance of the
                 presented method is evaluated on the table transport
                 problem and a simple version of simulated robot soccer
                 problem. Simulation results show that coevolutionary
                 fitness switching provides an effective mechanism for
                 learning complex collective behaviors which may not be
                 evolved by simple genetic programming.",

                 genetic program returns just one floating point number
                 that is then translated into different class labels,
                 this approach invents a new program structure with
                 multiple outputs, each for a particular class. A voting
                 scheme is then applied to these output values to
                 determine the class of the input object. The approach
                 is examined and compared with the standard genetic
                 programming approach on four multiclass object
                 classification tasks with increasing difficulty. The
                 results show that the new approach outperforms the
                 basic approach on these problems. A characteristic of
                 the proposed program structure is that it can easily
                 produce multiple outputs for multiclass object
                 classification problems, while still keeping the
                 advantages of the standard genetic programming approach
                 for easy crossover and mutation. This approach can
                 solve a multiclass object recognition problem using a
                 single evolved program in a single run.",

                 stages for pattern classification as well as optimizing

                 project the input space into a decision space with
                 maximized class separability. The steady-state Pareto
                 converging genetic programming (PCGP) has been used to
                 implement this multi-dimensional MOGP. We examine the
                 proposed method using eight benchmark datasets from the
                 UCI database and the Statlog project to make
                 quantitative comparison with conventional classifiers.
                 We conclude that MMOGP outperforms the comparator
                 classifiers due to its optimized feature extraction
